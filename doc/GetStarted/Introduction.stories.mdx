**Hitachi Design System** initiative produces reusable patterns and captures common methodologies, reducing design and implementation effort.

It stands as a catalyzer for design alignment and governance across the organization, generating a unique and characteristic design language, capable of positioning Hitachi as a worldwide design reference.

### UI-Kit React

This **UI Kit** provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable React components to build their applications, that guarantees the alignment with the Design System specifications.

It enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.

The UI Kit components are divided in three groups:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Core</strong> - <em>v{corePackage.version}</em> - components that are fully compliant
    with Design system guidelines and UI Kit best practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lab</strong> - <em>v{labPackage.version}</em> - components contributed by external teams
    for specific use cases and not fully compliant with Design System guidelines, so use it
    carefully.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Icons</strong> - <em>v{iconsPackage.version}</em> - icons provided by Design System,
    wrapped in React Components
  </li>
</ul>
