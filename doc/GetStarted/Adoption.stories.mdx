# Adoption

## What is it?

The Adoption project exists to provide a modern workflow environment and an example 
application that implements UI Kit patterns and code strategies in order to guide and 
speed up your development.

It showcases several areas of a typical frontend application development: 

* HV UI Kit setup and integration
* React, TSX, and ES6 syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* TypeScript syntax support.
* REST and GraphQL integration:
  * SWR for REST calls: https://swr.vercel.app/
  * Apollo for GraphQL: https://www.apollographql.com/
* A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
* A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
* A build script to bundle TS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
* Dynamic Routing with react-router.
* Dynamic loading & with react-loadable.
* Internationalization with react-i18next.
* Prettier and ESLint to promote code consistency.

The project uses a free public API for its backend integration: [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) 
and consists of a few pages that exercise the aforementioned technologies.
