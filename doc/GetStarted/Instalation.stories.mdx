# Installation

HV UI Kit is available as multiple npm packages. You can install them in any working React v16.x project.

## Configuring the npm registry

The packages are being published to a corporate Hitachi Vantara npm registry.
To be able to use them, you need to associate the `@hv` scope with that registry using `npm config`:

```shell
npm config set @hv:registry https://repo.orl.eng.hitachivantara.com/artifactory/api/npm/uikit-npm-release-orl/
```

You can check if your `~/.npmrc` is already configured by running `npm config ls`.

## Package installation

Install the `@hv/uikit-react-core` package and its peer dependencies:

```shell
npm install @hv/uikit-react-core @material-ui/core@^4.11.0 plotly.js-basic-dist@^1.55.2
```

### Other packages available

If you need to use any non-core community contributed package, install the `@hv/uikit-react-lab` package.

```shell
npm install @hv/uikit-react-lab
```

Also available:

- code-editor - `npm install @hv/uikit-react-code-editor`
- icons - `npm install @hv/uikit-react-icons`
- themes - `npm install @hv/uikit-common-themes`

The `@hv/uikit-react-icons` is installed as a dependency of `@hv/uikit-react-core` and the `@hv/uikit-common-themes` shouldn't be necessary out of a very specific use case.

### Installing an older version

The above commands will install the latest version of **UI Kit 3.x**. It implements the **DS 3.x** specifications.

If your project's design follows **DS 1.x** you must use the **UI Kit 2.x** release. Install it by suffixing "@2.\*" to the package names:

```shell
npm install @hv/uikit-react-core@2.*
```

The peer dependencies will also be different:

```shell
npm install @material-ui/core@~4.8.0 plotly.js@>1.34.0
```

## Usage

1. Wrap your application with the `HvProvider` provided by `@hv/uikit-react-core`.

```jsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hv/uikit-react-core";

// Do this at the root of your application
function App({ children }) {
  return <HvProvider>{children}</HvProvider>;
}
```

Optionally, you can configure the active theme and locale, among others.
Check <LinkTo kind="Foundation/Provider" story="Main" className="sbdocs-a">the Provider's API documentation</LinkTo> for further details.

2. Now you can start using components:

```jsx
import { HvButton } from "@hv/uikit-react-core";

function Example() {
  return <HvButton>Hello from UI Kit!</HvButton>;
}
```
