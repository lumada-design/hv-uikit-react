# Adoption

## What is it?

The Adoption project exists to provide a modern workflow environment and an example
application that implements UI Kit patterns and code strategies in order to guide and
speed up your development.

It showcases several areas of a typical frontend application development:

- HV UI Kit setup and integration
- React, TSX, and ES6 syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- TypeScript syntax support.
- REST and GraphQL integration:
  - SWR for REST calls: https://swr.vercel.app/
  - Apollo for GraphQL: https://www.apollographql.com/
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle TS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- Dynamic Routing with react-router.
- Dynamic loading & with react-loadable.
- Internationalization with react-i18next.
- Prettier and ESLint to promote code consistency.

The project uses a free public API for its backend integration: [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/)
and consists of a few pages that exercise the aforementioned technologies.
