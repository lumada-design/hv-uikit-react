# Forms

The UIKit provides a set of **Form Components** with a consistent API that can be used to build your own forms following de HV Design specs.

The base API of all the form components is established by the **[Form Element](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/tree/master/packages/core/src/Forms/FormElement)** component.  
It provides the necessary props to listen to the events, manage the component **status** as well as a **value** prop to make each component **controlled**.

Today, these are the Form Components aligned with the base API:

- [Checkbox](?path=/docs/forms-checkbox--main)
- [Checkbox Group](?path=/docs/forms-checkbox-group--main)
- [Input](?path=/docs/forms-input--main)
- [Radio Button](?path=/docs/forms-radio-button--main)
- [Radio Button Group](?path=/docs/forms-radio-button-group--main)
- [SearchBox](?path=/docs/forms-search-box--main)
- [Selection List](?path=/docs/forms-selection-list--main)
- [Switch](?path=/docs/forms-switch--main)
- [TextArea](?path=/docs/forms-text-area--main)

We are actively improving the remaining form elements not yet fully aligned:

- [Date Picker](?path=/docs/forms-date-picker--main)
- [Dropdown](?path=/docs/forms-dropdown--main)
- [FileUploader](?path=/docs/forms-file-uploader--main)

#### React provides you with a lot of ways to handle forms:

In React, form data is usually handled by the components because form elements naturally keep some internal state.  
When doing custom validation or need to access form data you should handle the state with controlled components and control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute.

#### Form libraries

When working with React and forms there are a lot of complexities and intricacies that we all struggle with: form verbosity, form validations, and managing the state of the forms and its components.

There are libraries like **[Formik](https://formik.org/)** and **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** that can help you build forms with less pain.  
Both are solving the same problems, and we don't enforce the use of any of them.

Our **Form Components** are compatible with these libraries, but we recommend the use of **imperative set value functions** on each library when handling the onChange event of our components.  
While our APIs are nof fully aligned, this will be the most consistent way of managing the state of the forms and its components.
