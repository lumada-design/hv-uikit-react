# Styling

In this section we'll go through a few ways to go on with styling your components.

## Using inline styles

You can style a component by applying inline styles using the `style` attribute on the element / component. The value passed must be a Javascript object:

```jsx
<HvButton
  id=“button-id”
  category="ghost"
  onClick={() => onClickHandler()}
  style={{ backgroundColor: "red” }}
  >
  {buttonLabel}
</HvButton>
```

Since the value is a Javascript object, the properties must be in a camel case format.
In the example above the CSS property `background-color` is renamed to `backgroundColor`.
You can also extract the styling information to a separate object and use it in the `style` attribute:

```jsx
const buttonStyle = {
	backgroundColor: “red”
}

<HvButton
  id=“button-id”
  category="ghost"
  onClick={() => onClickHandler()}
  style={buttonStyle}
>
  {buttonLabel}
</HvButton>
```

## Styling patterns

Styles should be defined per component and placed in separate files beside the corresponding component,
which will then import and use them. This separation allows for code reuse and keeps components code much cleaner.

### Hook pattern

One of the ways you can style your components is to follow the hook pattern on React
(note: since it's using hooks, this pattern can only be used on functional components).
For that you can use the `makeStyles` hook on Material UI:

```css
import { makeStyles } from '@mui/styles';

const useStyles = makeStyles({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: "red"
  },
});

export default styles
```

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import useStyles from "./styles";

export default function CustomButton() {
  const classes = useStyles();

  return <HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
}
```

This pattern is also useful for creating CSS that requires some value to be dynamically calculated. For example:

```css
const HEADER_HEIGHT = 30;

const useStyles = makeStyles({
  content : {
    height: `calc(100vh - ${HEADER_HEIGHT}px`)
  },
});
```

### Higher-Order Component pattern

Another way to style your components is by using Material UI's `withStyles` on a **higher-order component** pattern
to wrap your component and pass styling props to it. One significant difference for the Hook pattern is that since
we're extending the original component with a `classes` object, anyone that wants to consume our component will have
the ability to extend or override these classes with their own.

Example:

```css
const styles = () => ({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: "red"
  }
})

export default styles
```

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { withStyles } from "@mui/styles";
import styles from "./styles";

function CustomButton({ classes }) {
  return <HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
}

export default withStyles(styles)(CustomButton);
```

## Overriding component classes on UI Kit components

UI Kit components are built using the HOC pattern mentioned above and expose several classes that are
used internally to the component and can be overridden from the outside (these classes are listed on each
of the components props tables on this documentation).

Lets look at a practical example:

```css
import { makeStyles } from "@mui/styles"

const useStyles = makeStyles(theme => ({
  root: {
    backgroundColor: theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo4
  },
  icon: {
    border: "1px solid blue"
  }
}))

export default styles
```

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import useStyles from "./styles";

export default function CustomButton() {
  const classes = useStyles();

  return (
    <HvButton
      classes={{
        root: classes.root,
        icon: classes.icon
    >
      {buttonLabel}
    </HvButton>
  );
}
```

Here we create styles for our button and use them to override specific classes on the UI Kit button that we're using.
This even allows us to access classes of internal components that we otherwise wouldn't be able to style. For example,
UI Kit's DropDownMenu component internally uses a UI Kit Button for an icon and exposes an `icon` class for it to be
styled:

```jsx
<HvDropDownMenu
  classes={{
    root: classes.dropDownMenu,
    icon: classes.dropDownMenuButton,
    iconSelected: classes.dropDownMenuButtonSelected,
  }}
  (...)
/>
```

## Accessing theme properties

We can access the theme properties on our stylesheets, independently of the pattern we're using. Please take a look at the [Theming]()
section for more details on the UI Kit theme and how you can use it on your app.

If you're using the HOC pattern, you can access your theme like this:

```css
const styles = theme => ({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo4
  }
})

export default styles
```

If you're using the Hook pattern, it's very similar:

```css
import { makeStyles } from "@mui/styles"

const styles = makeStyles(theme => ({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo4
  }
}))

export default styles
```

Notice that the theme is injected by the UI Kit Theme Provider in the styles allowing us to access its properties.

## Using clsx

**clsx** is a [small library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) that allows us to apply classnames to components on a conditional format. Lets look at a simple example:

```jsx
<HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>
```

Here, we’re applying the button style to our Button component, but what if we want to add another class based on some condition? Maybe we want to style the button differently if there’s an error on the page. We can do this by applying a second class conditionally:

```jsx
<HvButton className={clsx(classes.button, error && classes.error, !error && classes.valid)}>
  {buttonLabel}
</HvButton>
```

Here `error` is just a state variable that indicates whether or not we have an error on our page. We can do this in a slightly different way also:

```jsx
<HvButton className={clsx(
    classes.button,
    [classes.error]: error,
    [classes.valid]: !error
  )}>
  {buttonLabel}
</HvButton>
```

This is basically the same thing as the example before. If `error` evaluates to `true` then `classes.error` is applied, otherwise `classes.valid` is used.
