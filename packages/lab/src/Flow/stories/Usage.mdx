# Creating flows <a id="creating-flows" />

The NEXT UI Kit Flow component allows users to create dynamic and interactive flow diagrams to visualize, for example, business processes, data workflows or user journeys.
It leverages the [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) library under the hood.

Since this is a lab component, please keep in mind that it can be changed in the future.

To use the `HvFlow` component you'll need to define:

- Node types

Optionally you can also define:

- Node groups
- Initial nodes
- Initial edges
- Default actions that all nodes will have

## Sidebar <a id="sidebar" />

In the context of the flow component, we provide a sidebar that you can use to list your nodes and drag them to the canvas.
However, the use of this component is not mandatory, and you can create your own component if needed.

To create groups of nodes in the sidebar, you'll have to create node groups. These should have a set of basic properties:

```typescript
interface HvFlowNodeGroup {
  label: string;
  description?: string;
  color?: HvColorAny;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  items?: HvFlowGroupItem[];
}

interface HvFlowGroupItem {
  label: string;
  // Node type
  nodeType: string;
  // Initial node data used when the node is dropped in the canvas
  data?: unknown;
}
```

Example:

```tsx
const nodeGroups = {
  assets: {
    label: "Assets",
    color: "cat3",
    description: "Find here all the available assets.",
    icon: <Heart />,
    items: [{ nodeType: "asset", label: "Asset" }],
  },
  models: {
    label: "ML Model",
    color: "cat1",
    description: "Find here all the available models.",
    icon: <Favorite />,
    items: [{ nodeType: "model", label: "ML Model Prediction" }],
  },
};
```

You can then create the sidebar by using the `HvFlowSidebar` component as a property of the `HvFlow` component
and by providing your `nodeGroups`:

```tsx
<HvFlow
  nodeGroups={nodeGroups}
  sidebar={
    <HvFlowSidebar
      title="Add Node"
      description="Please choose within the options below"
    />
  }
  // ...
>
  (...)
</HvFlow>
```

If you want your nodes to be listed without being divided into groups, you can add the `flatten` property in the `HvFlowSidebar`.

## Layout <a id="layout" />

There a few controls that you can add to your flow to control its layout and some functionality. All of these are components that you
should pass as children of the `HvFlow` component.

### Background <a id="background" />

To add a background to the flow you should use the `<HvFlowBackground />` component. This is a wrapper around the
[Background](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/background/) component of `reactflow` and has the same API.

### Controls <a id="controls" />

To add the controls panel to the flow you should use the `<HvFlowControls />` component. This, again, uses the
[Controls](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/plugin-components/controls/) component from `reactflow` but you should check [our own
documentation](./?path=/docs/lab-flow--docs) for the `HvFlowControls` component also.

### Minimap <a id="minimap" />

To add the minimap of the flow, just add the `<HvFlowMinimap />` component as a child of the `HvFlow` component.

### Empty state <a id="empty-state" />

To add an empty state panel, you can add the `<HvFlowEmpty />` component as a child of the `HvFlow` component. This wraps UI Kit's `HvEmptyState`
component and shares the same API.

## Custom nodes and node types <a id="custom-nodes-and-node-types" />

The `HvFlowNode` component allows you to create your own nodes.
It provides a base for your own custom nodes and is not to be used directly as a node on the flow.

If you have defined `nodeGroups`, `groupId` should also be set on the node, to simplify its customization.
By providing `groupId`, the `color`, `icon`, and `title` properties will be automatically set
using the values defined by the node group. Otherwise, you can set `color`, `icon`, `title` directly on the node.

The parameters and the list of inputs and outputs are passed as a property of the `HvFlowNode` component.

Find an example of a custom node below.

```tsx
import { HvFlowNode, HvFlowNodeFC } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab";

export const CustomNode: HvFlowNodeFC = (props) => {
  return (
    <HvFlowNode
      expanded
      groupId="models"
      description="ML Model Prediction description"
      inputs={[
        {
          label: "Data",
          isMandatory: true,
          accepts: ["data"],
        },
      ]}
      outputs={[
        {
          label: "Prediction",
          isMandatory: true,
          provides: "prediction",
        },
      ]}
      params={[
        {
          id: "param",
          label: "Select an option",
          type: "select",
          options: [
            { id: "option1", label: "Option 1" },
            { id: "option2", label: "Option 2" },
            { id: "option3", label: "Option 3" },
          ],
        },
      ]}
      {...props}
    />
  );
};
```

## Inputs and outputs <a id="inputs-and-outputs" />

Nodes need inputs and/or outputs to connect to other nodes and they can be defined as properties of the component.
Below are the specifications for a single input and output.

```typescript
interface HvFlowNodeInput {
  id?: string;
  label: React.ReactNode;
  isMandatory?: boolean;
  accepts?: string[];
  maxConnections?: number;
}

interface HvFlowNodeOutput {
  id?: string;
  label: React.ReactNode;
  isMandatory?: boolean;
  provides?: string;
  maxConnections?: number;
}
```

You'll notice that an input have an `accepts` property and an output have a `provides` property. These are used to limit
how nodes connect to other nodes and as a descriptor of what a node provides or accepts. Thus, for example, if an output of a node
provides `"config"`, only nodes with inputs that accept this string will allow a connection from that output. While inputs can accept an array of strings,
an output only provides one. If, instead, you want a node input to accept outputs from any other node without restrictions,
you only need to set the `accepts` property to an empty array or, alternatively, not setting the `accepts` at all.

Furthermore, it's also possible to define the maximum number of connections allowed for a particular input and output. This enables you to limit
the number of connections an input accepts as well as the number of connections an output can establish.

Nodes can also accept groups of inputs and outputs. These groups are defined by the types below.

```typescript
interface HvFlowNodeInputGroup {
  label: React.ReactNode;
  inputs: HvFlowNodeInput[];
}

interface HvFlowNodeOutputGroup {
  label: React.ReactNode;
  outputs: HvFlowNodeOutput[];
}
```

## Parameters <a id="parameters" />

A node can also have parameters of several types and they will be rendered in the node as an element that corresponds to the parameter type.
The parameters follow the following types:

```typescript
interface HvFlowNodeTextParam {
  type: "text";
  id: string;
  label: string;
}

interface HvFlowNodeSelectParam {
  type: "select";
  id: string;
  label: string;
  multiple?: boolean;
  // Prefer using an array of objects
  options?: string[] | { id: string; label: string }[];
}

interface HvFlowNodeSharedParam extends Omit<HvSliderProps, "id" | "label"> {
  type: "slider";
  id: string;
  label: string;
}

type HvFlowNodeParam =
  | HvFlowNodeSelectParam
  | HvFlowNodeTextParam
  | HvFlowNodeSliderParam;
```

Whenever a change is made on a parameter while using the flow, that change is saved on the node's `data` property in the `reactflow` instance.
It's saved in the form of:

```
data: {
  [parameterId]: [parameterValue]
}
```

Current parameter types supported by the `HvFlow` component:

- `text`: renders an input box;
- `select`: renders a dropdown and uses the `options` array to create the dropdown options. If `multiple` is set to `true`, a multiple select dropdown is used.
- `slider`: renders a slider and uses the `minPointValue`, `maxPointValue`, `markStep` and `divisionQuantity` to create the slider options and build the slider axis.

## Actions <a id="actions" />

Nodes can have two types of actions:

- Default actions that are a set of pre-defined actions that all nodes share. At the moment, the default actions are delete and duplicate;
- Custom actions that are set at the (custom) node level.

### Default actions <a id="default-actions" />

The default actions are passed directly to the `HvFlow` component:

```tsx
const defaultActions: HvFlowDefaultActions[] = [
  { id: "delete", label: "Delete", icon: <Delete /> },
  { id: "duplicate", label: "Duplicate", icon: <Duplicate /> },
];

<HvFlow
  defaultActions={defaultActions}
  // ...
>
  (...)
</HvFlow>;
```

The `id` property will be typed to be one of the allowed default actions.

### Custom actions <a id="custom-actions" />

At the node level you can specify other actions. To achieve this you'll have to define:

- A set of actions (`actions`);
- A callback to handle these actions (`onAction`);
- A maximum number of visible actions (`maxVisibleActions`). All the other actions will be placed in a dropdown menu. By default, only one action is visible;
- And whether the actions should be all icon buttons when visible (`actionsIconButton`). By default, this is set to `true`.

```tsx
const handleAction = (event: React.SyntheticEvent, action: HvActionGeneric) => {
  const node: Node | undefined = reactFlowInstance.getNode(id);
  if (!node) return;

  switch (action.id) {
    case "details": {
      break;
    }
    case "favorite": {
      break;
    }
    default:
      break;
  }
};

<HvFlowNode
  groupId="assets"
  description="Asset description"
  maxVisibleActions={1}
  actions={[
    {
      id: "details",
      label: "View Details",
      icon: <Search />,
    },
    {
      id: "favorite",
      label: "Add Favorite",
      icon: <Favorite />,
    },
  ]}
  onAction={handleAction}
  {...props}
/>;
```

## Footer <a id="footer" />

You can pass any content to the footer of the Node through the `footer` property:

```tsx
<HvFlowNode
  footer={<div>My footer content</div>}
  // ...
/>
```

## Custom content <a id="custom-content" />

If any of the previous topics are not enough for your use case, you can also pass some custom content to the `HvFlowNode` component:

```tsx
<HvFlowNode>
  <div>My custom content</div>
</HvFlowNode>
```

## Advanced use <a id="advanced-use" />

### Accessing the React Flow instance <a id="react-flow-instance" />

While creating a custom node you might find you need to have access to the node instance to get some details about it and do some operations
like knowing the parents of the node.

To facilitate this, we provide a set of specialized hooks:

- `useFlowNode(id?: string)`: Retrieves the node instance.
- `useFlowNodeParents(id?: string)`: Gets the parent nodes of a specified node (nodes that have an output connected to one of the inputs of the node).
- `useFlowNodeInputEdges(id?: string)`: Provides the input edges connected to the node.
- `useFlowNodeOutputEdges(id?: string)`: Gives the output edges connected from the node.
- `useFlowNodeEdges(id?: string)`: Offers both input and output edges of the node.
- `useFlowInputNodes(id?: string)`: Retrieves the nodes connected to the inputs of the node.
- `useFlowOutputNodes(id?: string)`: Gets the nodes connected to the outputs of the node.
- `useFlowNodeUtils(id?: string)`: Offers utilities to manipulate the node in the flow.

A node id can be passed to the hooks mentioned above to retrieve the data for a particular node.
If no id is provided, the hooks will automatically assume the id of the node it is used inside to avoid manually passing down the id as a prop.

Find below an example usage in a custom node component.

```tsx
export const Asset: HvFlowNodeFC = (props) => {
  // The hooks automatically assume the id (props.id) of the Asset node
  const node = useFlowNode();
  const parentNodes = useFlowNodeParents();

  // ...
};
```

We also offer a hook that retrieves the `reactflow` instance directly:

```tsx
const instance = useFlowInstance();
```

For more advanced operations, you can directly access the underlying store that `reactflow` uses to access specific parts of the state using the
`useStore` hook provided by the React Flow library.

To access specific parts of the React Flow state with minimal impact on performance, use the `useStore` hook.
This hook is re-exported from the Zustand state management library and allows for creating finely-tuned selectors:

```tsx
const selectedNodesSelector = (state) => {
  return state.nodes.filter((node) => node.selected);
};

export const Asset: HvFlowNodeFC = (props) => {
  const selectedNodes = useStore(selectedNodesSelector);

  // ...
};
```

Other hooks, provided by the React Flow, are also available depending on your needs, like the `useNodes` and `useEdges` hooks.
However, it's important to note that components using `useNodes` and `useEdges` will re-render whenever any node or edge changes.
This includes selections and movements of nodes, which can affect performance in complex flows.

Prefer using `useStore` with specific selectors to reduce the number of re-renders, ensuring that components only update when necessary.

Please check the [React Flow documentation](https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/hooks/use-react-flow/) to get more information,
specially on the hooks section.

### Saving and exporting data <a id="saving-and-exporting-data" />

Like mentioned in the [Parameters](#parameters) section, data is saved in the `data` property of the node object in the `reactflow` instance.
If you need to have more complex use cases for your nodes and need to store data, you should follow the same logic and use the `data` property.
The `reactflow` instance provides the `setNodes` function to save and update the nodes list. Alternatively, the `useFlowNodeUtils` hook provides
an utility function called `setNodeData` to update the data of the node the hook was used on.

If you need to export your data at any point you can use the `toObject` function on the `instance` object.

## Custom node example <a id="custom-node-example" />

Below you can find a full example of a custom Node that exercises the topics approached in this page.

```tsx
const classes = {
  container: css({
    width: "40%",
    minHeight: 200,
  }),
};

export const Asset: HvFlowNodeFC = (props) => {
  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false);
  const [details, setDetails] = useState<Node | undefined>();

  const node = useFlowNode();

  const handleAction = (
    event: React.SyntheticEvent,
    action: HvActionGeneric,
  ) => {
    if (!node) return;

    switch (action.id) {
      case "details": {
        setDetails(node);
        setShowDialog(true);
        break;
      }
      default:
        break;
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <HvDialog
        open={showDialog}
        onClose={() => setShowDialog(false)}
        classes={{ paper: classes.container }}
      >
        <HvDialogTitle>Asset</HvDialogTitle>
        <HvDialogContent>{JSON.stringify(details?.data)}</HvDialogContent>

            label: "Select a type",
            type: "select",
            options: [
              { id: "asset1", label: "Asset 1" },
              { id: "asset2", label: "Asset 2" },
              { id: "asset3", label: "Asset 3" },
            ],
          },
        ]}
        inputs={[
          {
            label: "Asset Config",
            isMandatory: true,
            accepts: ["assetConfig"],
          },
        ]}
        outputs={[
          {
            label: "Sensor Group 1",
            isMandatory: true,
            provides: "sensorData",
          },
          {
            label: "Sensor Group 2",
            isMandatory: true,
            provides: "sensorData",
          },
        ]}
        {...props}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```
