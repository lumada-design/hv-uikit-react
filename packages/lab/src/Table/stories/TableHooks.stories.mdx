# Table hooks

The UI Kit library provides a collection of **custom hooks** that ease the integration with the <LinkTo kind="Lab/Table" story="Main" className="sbdocs sbdocs-a">HvTable elements</LinkTo> and allows more advanced use cases and better data handling.

Our custom hooks are built on top of [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com) which is an "headless" UI utility library to build data tables while retaining control over markup and styles. It consists of a collection of, lightweight, composable and extensible custom React hooks.

## `useHv*` hooks

For further ease, you can use the provided `useHvTable` hook that wraps the [React Table's `useTable` hook](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useTable) and
provides the following functionality:

- Ensures the use of the needed core and layout plugins when using any of the UI Kit custom hooks (e.g. adding `useHvPagination` implies the instalation of React Table's `usePagination` hook).
- Automatically installs the `useHvTableStyles` hook.
- Generates default column metadata from the data fields, if the `columns` option is missing.
- Defaults to an empty array if no `data` is provided.

<Usage>{'import { useHvTable } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab";'}</Usage>

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.UseHvTable} />
</Preview>

The following plugin hooks are available:

- `useHvTableStyles`: ensures the correct styling of the table by injecting the column's `variant` and `align` options into the `HvTableHeader` and `HvTableCell` components (via `getHeaderProps` and `getCellProps`, respectively).
  Also adds support for injecting the `styles`, `className` and `classes` into the `HvTable`, `HvTableHeader` and `HvTableCell` components.
- `useHvPagination`: eases the wiring of the `HvPagination` component when using pagination. See <a href="#pagination" className="sbdocs-a">Pagination</a>.
- `useHvRowSelection`: creates and manages the UI for selecting rows. See <a href="#selection" className="sbdocs-a">Selection</a>.
- `useHvBulkActions`: eases the wiring of the `HvBulkActions` component. See <a href="#bulk-selection-and-actions" className="sbdocs-a">Bulk selection and actions</a>.
- `useHvSortBy`: manages the table's header sorting functionality. See <a href="#sorting" className="sbdocs-a">Sorting</a>.
- `useHvRowExpand`: manages the row expanding functionality. See <a href="#row-expanding" className="sbdocs-a">Row expanding</a>.
- `useHvTableSticky`: allows defining sticky headers and columns. See <a href="#sticky-headers-and-columns" className="sbdocs-a">Sticky Headers And Columns</a>.
- `useHvHeaderGroups`: allows defining grouped headers. See <a href="#grouped-headers" className="sbdocs-a">Grouped Headers</a>.

# Hooks usage

## useHvPagination

Data can be paginated. Optionally, empty lines can be added to the last page to avoid changes in height.

Check [React Table's `usePagination` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/usePagination) for configuration details.

The `useHvPagination` hook makes the `getHvPaginationProps` function available on the table instance returned that can be used to setup a `HvPagination` component.

_Note: This hook depends on the `usePagination` hook from `react-table`, but when using `useHvTable` only `useHvPagination` needs to be installed._

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.Pagination} />
</Preview>

## useHvRowSelection

Rows can be selected individually.

Check [React Table's `useRowSelect` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useRowSelect) for configuration details.

The `useHvRowSelecion` hook injects a new column with a `HvCheckBox` to select each row. It also manages the `HvTableRow`'s `isSelected` property via the `getRowProps`.

This hook is originally based on the code `useRowSelect` hook from `react-table` and implements its API, but extends it with support for locking the selection state of individual rows.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.Selection} />
</Preview>

## useHvRowSelection controlled

A selection state can also be included in the data and toggled externally.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.ControlledSelection} />
</Preview>

## useHvBulkActions

Rows can also be selected in bulk and actions can be performed on the current selection.

The `useHvBulkActions` hook makes the `getHvBulkActionsProps` function available on the table instance returned that can be used to setup a `HvBulkActions` component.

_Note: This hook depends on the `useRowSelect` hook from `react-table`, but when using `useHvTable` only `useHvBulkActions` needs to be installed._

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.BulkActions} />
</Preview>

## useHvSortBy

Tables can have the capability of sorting the data by column.
Clicking a sortable column header toggles between ascending or descending. Multiple sorting criteria is enabled through holding shift while clicking.

Check [React Table's `useSortBy` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useSortBy) for configuration details.

The `useHvSortBy` hook ensures that the proper properties are injected in the `HvTableHeader` (including the on click sorting trigger) and `HvTableCell` (for styling).

_Note: This hook depends on the `useSortBy` hook from `react-table`, but when using `useHvTable` only `useHvSortBy` needs to be installed._

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.Sortable} />
</Preview>

## useHvRowExpand

Tables rows can have the capability of being expanded to show more details.

Check [React Table's `useExpanded` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useExpanded) for configuration details.

The `useHvRowExpand` hook injects a `HvButton` into the first data column that toggles each row expansion. If the column has a custom renderer, an extra column is created instead.

_Note: This hook depends on the `useExpanded` hook from `react-table`, but when using `useHvTable` only `useHvRowExpand` needs to be installed._

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.Expandable} />
</Preview>

## useGroupBy

Tables rows can have the capability of being expanded to show more details.

Check [React Table's `useGroupBy` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useGroupBy) for configuration details.

This example requires useHvRowExpand to show the grouped rows.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.GroupBy} />
</Preview>

## useHvTableSticky

The table headers can be fixed at the top, allowing it to keep always visible when table has vertical scrolling enabled.

It is also possible to stick columns, either on the left or on the right, making them always visible when scrolling horizontally.

This is implemented using the `useHvTableSticky` custom React Table hook provided by the UI Kit library.

When using sticky columns, all column widths will be fixed and a non-table-element layout is applied.

### Configuration

The following options are supported via the main options object passed to `useTable(options)`:

- `stickyHeader: Bool`
  - Enables the sticky header

The following options are supported on any `Column` object passed to the `columns` options in `useTable()`:

- `sticky: "left" | "right"`
  - Sticks this column to the defined side. Columns will be re-orderer if needed.
- `width: Int`
  - Defaults to 150
  - Specifies the width for the column
- `minWidth: Int`
  - Defaults to 0
  - Specifies the minimum width for the column

### Usage

The `getTableProps`, `getTableHeadProps`, `getHeaderGroupProps`, `getHeaderProps`, `getTableBodyProps`, `getRowProps` and `getCellProps` prop getters must be called and the properties injected into the corresponding elements.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.StickyHeadersAndColumns} />
</Preview>

## useHvHeaderGroups

The table columns can be grouped, allowing it to have header groups.

Check [React Table's `useTable#column-options` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useTable#column-options) for configuration details.

This is implemented using the `useHvHeaderGroups` custom React Table hook provided by the UI Kit library.

When using grouped columns, all header group columns text will be centered.

### Configuration

The following options are supported on any `Column` object passed to the `columns` options in `useTable()`:

- `columns: Array<Column>`
  - A nested array of columns. If defined, the column will act as a header group. Columns can be recursively nested as much as needed.

### Usage

The `getTableProps`, `getHeaderGroupProps`, `getHeaderProps`, `getTableBodyProps`, `getRowProps` and `getCellProps` prop getters must be called and the properties injected into the corresponding elements.

# Other use cases

## Empty Cells

The absence of data within an individual cell in the table should be displayed as a `â€”` (_em dash_), according to Design System guidelines.

This must be handled by the developer in the respective cell renderer, as it is an guideline and not a strict rule.
Different use cases may require different solutions, like `N/A` or `0`. Empty cells should be avoided.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.EmptyCells} />
</Preview>

## Locked Selection

Individual rows can have its selection state locked (becoming either not selectable or not unselectable), disabling the selection checkbox and also preventing the bulk actions to change the row state.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story inline story={stories.LockedSelection} />
</Preview>

## Alternative Layout

react-table provides some layout plugin hooks useful for instance when needing to virtualize rows and cells for performance or enabling user resizable tables/columns.
They rely on the core column options `width`, `minWidth` and `maxWidth`, that are used to calculate column and cell widths.

- `useBlockLayout` renders headers and cells as inline-block elements with explicit width.
- `useAbsoluteLayout` renders headers and cells as absolutely positioned elements with explicit width.
- `useFlexLayout` renders headers and cells as inline-block elements, with the `width` being used as the `flex-basis` and `flex-grow`.

Note that not all built-in styles will apply when using any of the alternative layouts, so aditional styling might be needed to acomplish the same look.
Also, styles affecting element's widths (`width`, `min-width`, `max-width` and flex properties) must be avoided and the core column options used instead.

Most layouts work well with the default html table elements, keeping the semantics while loosing the table layout rules.
Elements can be changed (to `div` or any other apropriate html element) by using the `component` property.

`useGridLayout` implies a totally diferent dom structure and is currently not supported by the HvTable components.

## Drag and Drop

react-table has an example which integrates the react-dnd / react-beautiful-dnd libraries to provide drag and drop capability on lines.
Please check the documentation of [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) in case you want to extend this example.

This sample is not a clean react-beautiful-dnd implementation because it is applied to a table and requires some custom work to maintain the
layout of the table line (and its cell contents) while dragging. Please check https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/blob/master/docs/patterns/tables.md
for more information.

This behavior does not match 100% the Design System guidelines, although it offers a solution which implements the behavior and adds an accessible way for
doing the drag/drop operation via `SPACE + ARROW` Keys.

## Column Resize

Columns can be resized using the useHvResizeColumn hook, which leverages the react-table capabilities. 
Resize, although not an accessible functionality, it allows columns to be resizable via dragging column right border.
