      Hitachi Design System initiative produces reusable patterns and captures
      common methodologies, reducing design and implementation effort.
      <br />
      It stands as a catalyzer for design alignment and governance across the
      organization, generating a unique and characteristic design language,
      capable of positioning Hitachi as a worldwide design reference.

    <div className={classes.title}>UI Kit</div>
    <div className={classes.block2}>
      This UI Kit provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of
      reusable React components to build their applications.
      <br />
      It enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in
      prototype and production work.
      <br />
      <br />
      The UI Kit components are divided in two groups:
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className={classes.span}> Core - </span>
      components that are fully compliant with Design system guidelines and UI
      Kit best practices.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className={classes.span}> Lab - </span>
      components contributed by external teams for specific use cases and not
      fully compliant with Design System guidelines, so use it carefully.
