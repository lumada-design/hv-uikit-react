### In case of button without text an alternative description must be provided using:
- aria-labelledby or aria-label
- aria-describedby that points to the id of an element containing the description

### All functionality should be available from a keyboard
 
- Following button activation, focus is set depending on the type of action the button performs. 


### No Keyboard Trap
- If keyboard focus can be moved to a button using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from the button using only a keyboard interface.

### Focus Order
- If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable buttons receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.

### Label in Name
- For buttons with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually.
- When using aria-labelledby, aria-label or aria-describedby these values must contain the text that is visible.
