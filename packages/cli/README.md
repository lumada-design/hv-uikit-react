# Hitachi Vantara UI Kit CLI

The Hitachi Vantara CLI for UI Kit apps.

This CLI provides a way to automate tasks you regularly perform as part of your development workflow.

Whether is quickly start a new application or scaffolding out templates and components, it will help you standardize these tasks in a consistent, and predictable manner.

## Usage

For usage documentation, run the CLI with the `--help` option for any `<command>`. Examples:

```sh

npx @hitachivantara/hv-uikit-cli@latest <command> --help
