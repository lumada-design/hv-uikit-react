# Canvas

This section showcases all the Pentaho+ canvas components. At the moment, the following components are available:

- [Side Panel](./?path=/docs/pentaho-canvas-side-panel--docs)
- [Toolbar](./?path=/docs/pentaho-canvas-toolbar--docs)

As a disclaimer, it's important to note that all canvas components are a work in progress and there might be breaking changes.
