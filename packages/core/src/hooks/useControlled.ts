// based in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mui-org/material-ui/next/packages/material-ui/src/utils/useControlled.js
// modifications:
// 1. renamed default to initialState, to convey the same meaning of the useState hook.
// 2. removed the console error when initialState changes; that is acceptable and just ignored, like in useState.
// 3. the console error regarding switching from controlled to uncontrolled (or vice-versa) is sent synchronously
//    so the stacktrace shows the caller
// 4. given that, the hook signature was simplified, no need for metadata
