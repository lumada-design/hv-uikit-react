# Query Builder

The query builder component enables you to create conditions and then group them using logical operators to create structured sets of rules.
The output of this component can be easily parsed to create SQL, NoSQL, or any other type of query depending on your use case.

Summary:

- [Attributes](#attributes)
- [Combinators](#combinators)
- [Operators](#operators)
- [Renderers](#renderers)
  - [Defining renderers](#defining-renderers)

## Attributes <a id="attributes" />

To use this component, you'll need to define your attributes using the `attributes` property. This property receives an object with all the
attributes you'll be able to choose from to create conditions in the query builder.

An attribute has the following specification:

```tsx
interface HvQueryBuilderAttribute {
  id?: string;
  label: string;
  type: "boolean" | "numeric" | "dateandtime" | "text" | "textarea" | string;
}
```

The query builder already has 5 built-in attribute types, `boolean`, `numeric`, `text`, `textarea`, and `dateandtime`, but custom ones can be created if needed.

Find below an example for the `attributes` property using custom and built-in attribute types.

```tsx
const attributes: HvQueryBuilderProps["attributes"] = {
  attr1: {
    label: "Numeric",
    type: "numeric",
  },
  attr2: {
    label: "Text",
    type: "text",
  },
  attr3: {
    label: "Text Area",
    type: "textarea",
  },
  attr4: {
    label: "Boolean",
    type: "boolean",
  },
  attr5: {
    label: "Date & Time",
    type: "dateandtime",
  },
  attr6: {
    label: "Custom",
    type: "custom",
  },
};
```

## Combinators <a id="combinators" />

The query builder already has 2 default combinator operands used out of the box: `or` and `and`. This set of combinators enables you to define how your
conditions can be combined together.

If you want to override the default combinators and define new ones, you can use the `combinators` property that receives an array of combinators
where each combinator has the following specification:

```tsx
interface HvQueryBuilderQueryCombinator {
  operand: string;
  label: string;
}
```

Find an example of `combinators` below.

```tsx
const combinators: HvQueryBuilderProps["combinators"] = [
  { operand: "or", label: "OR" },
  { operand: "and", label: "AND" },
];
```

## Operators <a id="operators" />

After defining your `attributes`, you'll need to specify the operators for each one of your attribute types through the `operators` property.
This property enables you to define the conditions' operators by attribute type and combinator.

The query builder already has default `operators` for each built-in attribute type and they are used out of the box.
The default operators are available through the `hvQueryBuilderDefaultOperators` object exported by the `core` package.
However, you'll most likely need to override these operators depending on your use case.

An operator has the following specification:

```tsx
interface HvQueryBuilderQueryOperator {
  operator: string;
  label: string;
  combinators: string[];
}
```

Find below an example for the `operators` property.

```tsx
const operators: HvQueryBuilderProps["operators"] = {
  // Using the default operators for the "boolean", "numeric", "text", "textarea", and "dateandtime" attribute types
  ...hvQueryBuilderDefaultOperators,
  // Defining the operators for the "custom" attribute type
  custom: [
    {
      operator: "equalsTo",
      label: "Equal to (=)",
      combinators: ["and", "or"],
    },
    {
      operator: "notEqual",
      label: "Not equal to (!=)",
      combinators: ["and", "or"],
    },
    {
      operator: "Empty",
      label: "Empty",
      combinators: ["and", "or"],
    },
  ],
};
```

## Renderers <a id="renderers" />

Having `attributes`, `operators`, and `combinators` enables you to have a fully functional query builder since this component already has
some intrinsic behavior.

For instance, the query builder already has built-in value renderers, i.e. inputs to type the condition's value, for the default attribute types
`boolean`, `numeric`, `text`, `textarea`, and `dateandtime`. For custom attribute types, a basic text input is rendered by default.
Moreover, if the `range` operator is selected, the condition's value is cleared automatically, and the value renderer updates to range inputs
for the `numeric` and `dateandtime` attribute types.

This component also has a default behavior for the `Empty` and `IsNotEmpty` operators. When they are selected, the condition's value is cleared
and an empty component is rendered for the value. This behavior is configured through the `emptyRenderer` property, which enables you to define
the operators that should reset the condition's value and render an empty component when selected.

If you don't want to rely on the default behavior provided by the query builder and the built-in value renderers are not enough to cover your use case,
it's possible to customize them through the `renderers` property. This property enables you to customize the value renderers for specific operators and
attribute types.

When customizing the query builder, you should note that `emptyRenderer` takes priority over `renderers`.

Find below an example on how to customize the value renderers through the `renderers` property.

```tsx
const renderers: HvQueryBuilderProps["renderers"] = {
  // Renderer for the custom attribute type "custom"
  custom: CustomRenderer,

  text: {
    // Renderer to customize the "Contains" operator of the "text" attribute type
    Contains: ContainsRenderer,
  },

  numeric: {
    // Renderer to customize the "numeric" attribute type
    DEFAULT: NumericRenderer,
    // Renderer to customize the "range" operator of the "numeric" attribute type
    range: RangeRenderer,
  },
};
```

In the example above, 4 renderers were provided:

- `CustomRenderer` will be used to render the value for the `custom` attribute type overriding the default text input used for custom
  attribute types.
- `ContainsRenderer` will be used to render the value for the `text` attribute type when the `Contains` operator is selected overriding
  the default for this operator. When any other operator is selected for this attribute, the query builder relies on its default behavior.
- `NumericRenderer` will be used to render the value for the `numeric` attribute type overriding the default renderer for this attribute
  type.
- `RangeRenderer` will be used to render the value for the `numeric` attribute type when the `range` operator is selected. This renderer
  takes precedence over `NumericRenderer` when overriding the default renderer.

If necessary, it's also possible to define value renderers at a more broad level using the `DEFAULT` key at the root of the `renderers`
object like shown below. You should be aware that `DEFAULT` is a reserved key you shouldn't use to define your own attribute or operator
types.

```tsx
// Example 1
const renderers: HvQueryBuilderProps["renderers"] = {
  // Renderer to customize all attribute types and operators
  DEFAULT: DefaultRenderer,
};

// Example 2
const renderers: HvQueryBuilderProps["renderers"] = {
  DEFAULT: {
    // Renderer to customize all attribute types and operators
    DEFAULT: DefaultRenderer,
    // Renderer to customize the "range" operator of all attribute types
    range: DefaultRangeRenderer,
  },
};
```

In the first example, the `DefaultRenderer` will be used to render the value for all attribute types and operators. However, in the second example,
the `DefaultRenderer` is used for all attribute types and operators except the `range` operator since the `DefaultRangeRenderer` will be used.
These customizations have the lowest priority meaning that any renderer defined at the attribute type level will take precedence.

Find below an example where the priorities are annotated.

```tsx
const renderers: HvQueryBuilderProps["renderers"] = {
  DEFAULT: {
    DEFAULT: DefaultRenderer, // 4
    range: DefaultRangeRenderer, // 3
  },

  numeric: {
    DEFAULT: NumericRenderer, // 2
    range: RangeRenderer, // 1
  },
};
```

Lastly, the depth of the query, i.e. the number of nested query groups, can be controlled through the `maxDepth` where the default value is `1`.
Furthermore, confirmation dialogs will always be shown by default when removing a condition or group. To change this behavior, the `disableConfirmation`
property is available.

### Defining renderers <a id="defining-renderers" />

The value renderers are function components that receive the following properties:

```tsx
interface HvQueryBuilderRendererProps<V = any> {
  id: React.Key;
  attribute: string;
  operator?: string;
  value?: V;
}
```

Find below an example of a value renderer.

```tsx
const Renderer = ({ id }: HvQueryBuilderRendererProps) => {
  const { dispatchAction } = useQueryBuilderContext();

  return (
    <HvSlider
      required
      label="Slider"
      onChange={(value) => {
        dispatchAction({
          type: "set-value",
          id,
          value,
        });
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

`dispatchAction` is needed to update the query and can be accessed through the `useQueryBuilderContext` hook exported by the `core` package.
This utility can be used to dispatch several action types such as: `reset-query`, `reset-group`, `add-rule`, `add-group`, `remove-node`,
`set-combinator`, `set-attribute`, `set-operator`, and `set-value`. However, you'll most likely only need the `set-value` action that enables
you to set the value of a condition. This action has the following specification:

```tsx
{
  type: "set-value";
  id: React.Key;
  value: any;
}
```
