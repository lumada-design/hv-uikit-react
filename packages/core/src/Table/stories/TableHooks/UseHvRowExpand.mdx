# useHvRowExpand

Tables rows can have the capability of being expanded to show more details.

Check [React Table's `useExpanded` documentation](https://react-table-v7-docs.netlify.app/docs/api/useExpanded) for configuration details.

The `useHvRowExpand` hook injects a `HvButton` into the first data column that toggles each row expansion. If the column has a custom renderer, an
extra column is created instead.

_Note: This hook depends on the `useExpanded` hook from `react-table`, but when using `useHvData` only `useHvRowExpand` needs to be installed._
