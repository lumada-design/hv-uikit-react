# useHvSortBy

Tables can have the capability of sorting the data by column. Clicking a sortable column header toggles between ascending or descending. Multiple sorting criteria
is enabled through holding shift while clicking.

Check [React Table's `useSortBy` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useSortBy) for configuration details.

The `useHvSortBy` hook ensures that the proper properties are injected in the `HvTableHeader` (including the on click sorting trigger) and `HvTableCell` (for styling).

_Note: This hook depends on the `useSortBy` hook from `react-table`, but when using `useHvData` only `useHvSortBy` needs to be installed._
