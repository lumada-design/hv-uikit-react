# useHvHeaderGroups

The table columns can be grouped, allowing it to have header groups.

Check [React Table's `useTable` documentation](https://react-table-v7-docs.netlify.app/docs/api/useTable#column-options) for configuration details.

This is implemented using the `useHvHeaderGroups` custom React Table hook provided by the UI Kit library.

When using grouped columns, all header group columns text will be centered.

## Configuration

The following options are supported on any `Column` object passed to the `columns` options in `useTable()`:

- `columns: Array<Column>`: A nested array of columns. If defined, the column will act as a header group. Columns can be recursively nested as much as needed.

## Usage

The `getTableProps`, `getHeaderGroupProps`, `getHeaderProps`, `getTableBodyProps`, `getRowProps`, and `getCellProps` prop getters must be called
and the properties injected into the corresponding elements.
