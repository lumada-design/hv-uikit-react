# useHvTableSticky

The table headers can be fixed at the top, allowing it to keep always visible when table has vertical scrolling enabled.

It is also possible to stick columns, either on the left or on the right, making them always visible when scrolling horizontally.

This is implemented using the `useHvTableSticky` custom React Table hook provided by the UI Kit library.

When using sticky columns, all column widths will be fixed and a non-table-element layout is applied.

## Configuration

The following options are supported via the main options object passed to `useTable(options)`:

- `stickyHeader: boolean`: Enables the sticky header.

The following options are supported on any `Column` object passed to the `columns` options in `useTable()`:

- `sticky: "left" | "right"`: Sticks this column to the defined side. Columns will be re-orderer if needed.
- `width: number`: Specifies the width for the column. Defaults to 150.
- `minWidth: number`: Specifies the minimum width for the column. Defaults to 0.

## Usage

The `getTableProps`, `getTableHeadProps`, `getHeaderGroupProps`, `getHeaderProps`, `getTableBodyProps`, `getRowProps`, and `getCellProps` prop getters must be
called and the properties injected into the corresponding elements.
