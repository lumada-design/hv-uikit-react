# Table Section

In recent minor versions updates of the Design System specification, several visual changes were introduced
that substantially change the look of the `Table` component. While UI Kit v5.x tries to keep up with the latest
Design System specification, adapting to these changes in a minor version update of the library would lead to breaking
changes that might not be wanted by our users as they may want to stick to the old layout, efectively locking the users
to a specific UI Kit version.

Recognizing the challenges posed by immediate adaptation and breaking changes on a minor version, we've introduced
the `HvTableSection` component. This component is designed to serve as a temporary solution allowing developers to benefit
from the updated visuals of the `Table` component if they wish to.

## How to use

If you want to use the new `Table` visuals on the tables in your application you just need to wrap your table code
with the `HvTableSection` component:

```tsx
<HvTableSection>{/* old table code */}</HvTableSection>
```

This will result in the table adapting to the new visuals:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Simple Table" story={SimpleTableSectionStory} />
</Canvas>

If your table includes more complex controls, like bulk actions or pagination, these are adapted just the same:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Complete Table" story={CompleteTableSectionStory} />
</Canvas>

The way the `HvTableSection` component works is by wrapping your table with the `HvSection` component. As such,
you can pass a set of section properties to the underlying `HvSection` component through the `sectionProps` property
and configure the section as you please. The sample below illustrates how you can have an expandable section
with a table inside and a set of actions.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Section Props" story={PropsTableSectionStory} />
</Canvas>
