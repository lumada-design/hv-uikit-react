# useHvRowSelection

Rows can be selected individually.

Check [React Table's `useRowSelect` documentation](https://react-table.tanstack.com/docs/api/useRowSelect) for configuration details.

The `useHvRowSelection` hook injects a new column with a `HvCheckBox` to select each row. It also manages the `HvTableRow's` `isSelected` property via the
`getRowProps`.

This hook is originally based on the code `useRowSelect` hook from react-table and implements its API, but extends it with support for locking the selection
state of individual rows.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="useHvSelection" story={UseHvSelectionStory} />
</Canvas>

## Controlled

A selection state can also be included in the data and toggled externally.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="useHvRowSelection controlled"
    story={UseHvSelectionControlledStory}
  />
</Canvas>
