# Alternative Layout

React-table provides some layout plugin hooks useful for instance when needing to virtualize rows and cells for performance or enabling user resizable
tables/columns. They rely on the core column options `width`, `minWidth`, and `maxWidth`, that are used to calculate column and cell widths.

- `useBlockLayout` Renders headers and cells as inline-block elements with explicit width.
- `useAbsoluteLayout` Renders headers and cells as absolutely positioned elements with explicit width.
- `useFlexLayout` Renders headers and cells as inline-block elements, with the `width` being used as the `flex-basis` and `flex-grow`.

Note that not all built-in styles will apply when using any of the alternative layouts, so additional styling might be needed to
accomplish the same look. Also, styles affecting element's widths (`width`, `min-width`, `max-width` and flex properties) must be
avoided and the core column options used instead.

Most layouts work well with the default html table elements, keeping the semantics while loosing the table layout rules. Elements can be changed
(to `div` or any other appropriate html element) by using the `component` property.

`useGridLayout` implies a totally different dom structure and is currently not supported by the `HvTable` components.
