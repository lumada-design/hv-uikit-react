# Table Samples

## Complete

Complete sample table that uses most of the features provided.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Complete" story={TableSamplesStories.CompleteStory} />
</Canvas>

## Empty Cells

The absence of data within an individual cell in the table should be displayed as a `â€”` (_dash_), according to Design System guidelines.

This must be handled by the developer in the respective cell renderer, as it is an guideline and not a strict rule. Different use
cases may require different solutions, like `N/A` or `0`. Empty cells should be avoided.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Empty Cells" story={TableSamplesStories.EmptyCellsStory} />
</Canvas>

## Locked Selection

Individual rows can have its selection state locked (becoming either not selectable or not unselectable), disabling the selection checkbox and also preventing
the bulk actions to change the row state.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Locked Selection"
    story={TableSamplesStories.LockedSelectionStory}
  />
</Canvas>

## Alternative Layout

react-table provides some layout plugin hooks useful for instance when needing to virtualize rows and cells for performance or enabling user resizable
tables/columns. They rely on the core column options `width`, `minWidth`, and `maxWidth`, that are used to calculate column and cell widths.

- `useBlockLayout` renders headers and cells as inline-block elements with explicit width.
- `useAbsoluteLayout` renders headers and cells as absolutely positioned elements with explicit width.
- `useFlexLayout` renders headers and cells as inline-block elements, with the `width` being used as the `flex-basis` and `flex-grow`.

Note that not all built-in styles will apply when using any of the alternative layouts, so additional styling might be needed to
accomplish the same look. Also, styles affecting element's widths (`width`, `min-width`, `max-width` and flex properties) must be
avoided and the core column options used instead.

Most layouts work well with the default html table elements, keeping the semantics while loosing the table layout rules. Elements can be changed
(to `div` or any other appropriate html element) by using the `component` property.

`useGridLayout` implies a totally different dom structure and is currently not supported by the `HvTable` components.

  <Story
    name="Alternative Layout"
    story={TableSamplesStories.AlternativeLayoutStory}
  />
</Canvas>

## Column Resize

Columns can be resized using the `useHvResizeColumn` hook, which leverages the react-table capabilities. Resize, although not an accessible functionality,
it allows columns to be resizable via dragging column right border.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Column Resize" story={TableSamplesStories.ColumnResizeStory} />
