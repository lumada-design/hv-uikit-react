# Empty Cells

The absence of data within an individual cell in the table should be displayed as a `â€”` (_dash_), according to Design System guidelines.

This must be handled by the developer in the respective cell renderer, as it is an guideline and not a strict rule. Different use
cases may require different solutions, like `N/A` or `0`. Empty cells should be avoided.
