# Complete Table

Complete sample table that uses most of the features provided.

The server-side pagination and row sorting is achieved by setting the `manualPagination` and `manualSortBy` properties.

The data is provided by a mock `useServerData` hook that provides the `data`/`loading` values, and `fetchData`/`mutateData` utilities to emulate data fetching.
A `LoadingContainer` indicator is included and visible whenever `loading` is `true`.
In a real-world scenario the `loading` state and CRUD operations are done with network requests (ie. `fetch`),
leveraging a data library such as [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/).

The absence of data within an individual cell is rendered with a `â€”` (em dash), according to Design System guidelines.
Different use cases may require different solutions, like `N/A` or `0`. Empty cells should be avoided.
In this example it's achieved by passing a custom `defaultColumn` to the `useHvTable` hook, but can be customized per-cell using the `Cell` property.

This sample encapsulates the rendering, the hook setup, and the actions logic in a generic `TableComplete` component.
