# Releases

We want to make sure our release schedule is clear to everyone. We are aware of the needs of external teams to not be blocked by our releases, for instance, a bug fix or a component being available on our lab (incubation) section.

## Versions

We follow the [Semantic Versioning Guidelines](https://semver.org/). This release breaks the version numbers in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- <b>MAJOR</b> version when your changes are not compatible with the current API.
- <b>MINOR</b> version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
- <b>PATCH</b> version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the <b>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</b> format.

## Scheduling

We trigger a release build of all our active branches every day. This means that all code merged during that day will be validated against our tests and a new release will be made public.
The release number will be automatically calculated, based on the commits pushed that day. In case nothing is changed, no release will happen.

When working on a major version, preview builds (alpha, beta or rc) should be available whenever we feel we have a good subset of things for teams to try out.

Every release changelogs will be available in the [github releases section](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/releases) and our [documentation](https://lumada-design.github.io/hv-uikit-react/) updated.
