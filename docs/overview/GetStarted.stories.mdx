# Get Started

All UI Kit packages are available through **npm**. The main package you'll need to install to get started with the UI Kit is `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core`,
which includes all the core components that are fully compliant with the **Design System**.

You can install the core package by running the following command inside your React project:

```
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-core @emotion/react @emotion/styled @emotion/css @mui/material
```

By running this command, you are installing the UI Kit core package as well as all its peer dependencies.

`react` and `react-dom`, which should already be included in your React project, are also peer dependencies of the `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core` package.
For UI Kit v5.x, versions 17.x and 18.x are currently supported for both `react` and `react-dom`.

### Install other UI Kit packages

The UI Kit core package is not the only one provided by our team. You can also install the following ones depending one your project's needs and requirements:

```
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-icons
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-styles
```

The peer dependencies for `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-icons` include `@emotion/styled`, `react`, and `react-dom`, and this package is also used internally by the
`uikit-react-core` package.

Regarding `@hitachivantara/uikit-styles`, it's not expected you'll need to install it in your project. This is mainly a package created for internal use
where all the Design System theming specifications are kept and is currently being used inside our packages.

At the moment, UI Kit v5.x is still not available for the following packages:

- `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz`
- `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-compat`
- `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-code-editor`
- `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab`
- `@hitachivantara/uikit-common-themes`: this package will not evolve beyond v4.x since it was replaced by `@hitachivantara/uikit-styles`

Over time, we will keep working toward aligning these packages with v5.x. However, until then, v4.x and v5.x packages can't be used simultaneously due to the
introduction of a new theming system not compatible with the v4.x components.

### Install older UI Kit packages versions

#### UI Kit v4.x

If your application needs to meet the specifications defined by **Design System 3.x**, you should use the UI Kit v4.x release. For more information, report to this
[page](https://lumada-design.github.io/uikit/master/?path=/docs/overview-installation--page).

#### UI Kit v3.x

UI Kit v3.x targets earlier versions of **Design System 3.x** and uses a different registry and import names. If needed, please follow the documentation
available on this [page](https://lumada-design.github.io/uikit/v3-old-registry/?path=/docs/get-started-installation--page).

#### UI Kit v2.x

If your application follows **Design System 1.x**, you must use the UI Kit v2.x release. Please, check this
[page](https://lumada-design.github.io/uikit/v2.x/?path=/docs/get-started-installation--page) for detailed instructions.

## Usage

### 1. Set up the provider

After installing the core package, you'll need to setup the `HvProvider`, which can be imported from `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core`,
and wrap your application with it like so:

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return <HvProvider>{children}</HvProvider>;
};
```

The example shown above illustrates the most simple setup to get you started with the UI Kit. This will initialize the UI Kit with the Design System version 5
and the dawn color mode. However, depending on your design requirements, you may need to implement your own themes. This can be achieved by applying the required
changes to the `HvProvider`. For more information on how to customize your themes, please report to the [provider](/docs/guides-provider--main) and [theming](/docs/guides-theming-default-themes--main-ds-5) documentation.

### 2. Load the default font

The UI Kit uses **Open Sans** as its default font family since it is the one defined by the Design System specifications. Thus, you'll need to ensure the font
is loaded properly since the UI Kit can't do it automatically.

This can be achieved through the **Google Web Fonts CDN** by using the following code inside your project's `<head>` tag:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Please, report to the [typography](/docs/foundation-typography--main) documentation for more information.

### 3. Use the components

After setting up the provider, you can now use the components provided by the UI Kit core package like so:

```tsx
import { HvTypography } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <HvTypography>Hello from the UI Kit team!</HvTypography>;
};
```

## Use an example project

In the UI Kit's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react) you can find inside the [`/examples` folder](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/tree/next-mirage/examples)
some example projects that can get you quickly started with UI Kit. You only need to download the example, install the dependencies, and run the project.

At the moment, you can find the following example projects:

- [Vite.js with TypeScript](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/tree/next-mirage/examples/uikit-vite-ts)

In the future, we will work toward providing more examples.
