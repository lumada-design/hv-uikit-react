| >= 91 |  >= 78  | >= 90  |     >= 14      | Not supported |

## DS alignment <a id="ds-alignment" />

While we strive to follow the [NEXT Design System](https://designsystem.hitachivantara.com/), we do not expect to support every component, nor every feature of every component, but rather to provide the building blocks to allow developers to create compelling user interfaces and experiences.

The following table shows the components alignment with **NEXT DS 5.6.0** and the identified **missing features** status.

### Status description

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>âœ…:</b> all the features have been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Supported:</b> the feature has been implemented in another component.
    Check the <b>Notes</b> column for more details.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Planned:</b> the feature is planned to be implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Not Planned:</b> there's no planning at the moment to implement the
    feature.
  </li>
</ul>

If you need a component or feature that is not supported, please reach out to us or check our [contribution guide](/docs/overview-community-contributing--page).
