## Supported browsers <a id="supported-browsers" />

NEXT UI Kit supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.

| Edge  | Firefox | Chrome | Safari (macOS) |     IE 11     |
| :---: | :-----: | :----: | :------------: | :-----------: |
| >= 91 |  >= 78  | >= 90  |     >= 14      | Not supported |

## Packages <a id="packages" />

In UI Kit v5.x some packages were deprecated and new ones were created as shown in the table below.

Bear in mind that v4.x and v5.x packages can't be used simultaneously due to the introduction of the new theming system not compatible with the v4.x components.
Thus, if you wish to keep using the deprecated packages, you can't update the other packages to v5.x.

| Package                                 |    Status    |

## Components <a id="components" />

While we strive to follow the NEXT Design System guidelines, we do not expect to support every component, nor every feature of every component, but rather to provide the building blocks to allow developers to create compelling user interfaces and experiences.

If you need a component or feature that is not supported, please reach out to us or check our [**contribution guide**](/docs/overview-community-contributing--page).

The following table shows the current status of each component and its features, as well as the NEXT DS alignment.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Components</th>
      <th>Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {Object.entries(data).map(([key, value]) => (
      <React.Fragment key={key}>
        <tr>
          <th colSpan="3">{key}</th>
        </tr>
        {value.map((item) => (
          <tr key={item.name}>
            <td>{item.name}</td>
            <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>{item.status}</td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </React.Fragment>
    ))}
