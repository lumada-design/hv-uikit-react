# Migration from v4.x to v5.x

The NEXT UI Kit v5 is one of our most ambitious release to date. In this version, we **implemented our own theming system** to help reduce the gap between the
Design System and UI Kit releases as well as improve our customization capabilities. In this sense, UI Kit v5 introduces the concept of **white labeling**
which enables the use of the UI Kit in different design scenarios to seamlessly meet clients' needs.

In this new version, we also reviewed the **components to be compliant with the most recent guidelines of the latest Design System v5 release**. Furthermore,
we also took the opportunity to **migrate our packages from MUI's JSS styling system to Emotion**. This change was due mainly to performance benefits
introduced by using Emotion over JSS.

Thus, in this page, you'll learn how to migrate from v4.x to v5.x. **If you are using UI Kit versions prior to v4.x, we encourage you to sequentially migrate
your project and go back to this page once you are on v4.x.**

Here's what there is to know about this migration:

## React packages <a id="react-packages" />

UI Kit v5.x supports versions 17.x and 18.x of `react` and `react-dom`. Thus, if you are using older versions, you should upgrade
them to avoid errors while using this new UI Kit version.

## UI Kit packages <a id="ui-kit-packages" />

Before proceeding to this upgrade, you should also note that **you can't use UI Kit packages v4.x and v5.x simultaneously** due to the introduction of a new theming
system not compatible with v4.x components. Thus, if your application relies on the packages or components below, you'll not be able to migrate your
application at the moment since their development are still in progress. Over time, we will align these packages with v5 and add the missing components.

- `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz`
- The following components from `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab` are missing:
  - Drawer
  - Image carrousel
  - Navigation anchors
  - Notification panel
- The following components from `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core` are missing:
  - Time picker
  - User preferences
  - Query builder

The `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-compat` and `@hitachivantara/uikit-common-themes` packages are **deprecated** in v5.

Learn more about the project status on this [page](/story/overview-project-status--page#packages).

If you are able to upgrade your application despite the limitations discussed above, upgrade the UI Kit packages to the latest v5.x versions
using the command below.

```
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-core@latest
```

## Emotion packages <a id="emotion-packages" />

In UI Kit v5.x, the `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled` packages are still peer dependencies. However, it is expected that you already have them installed
in your project since UI Kit v4.x already required them.

## MUI packages <a id="mui-packages" />

Even though we created a new theming system in this new version, we are still relying on some of the solutions provided by [MUI](https://mui.com/) as we have been
in previous versions. Our approach has always been to use the features we find value and enable them to our users. This philosophy did not change, and `@mui/material`
is still needed in v5.x as a peer dependency to run the `uikit-react-core` package.

In v5, MUI has migrated their styling solution from [JSS to Emotion](https://mui.com/blog/mui-core-v5/#migration-from-jss-to-emotion). Since previous versions of
the UI Kit were relying entirely on [MUI's JSS styling system](https://mui.com/system/styles/basics/), we decided to keep using this system in v4.x to give
us the time needed to do our own evaluation.

In the NEXT UI Kit v5, the necessary evaluations were made, and we decided to also make the switch to Emotion to style our components. Thus, the `@mui/styles` package
is no longer a peer dependency for the `uikit-react-core` package.

Since we are no longer using JSS styling system in our packages, we recommend that you also make the transition to Emotion. However, the NEXT UI Kit was not built
to be used with one specific styling library so you can keep using the one best suited for your needs.

### Breaking changes in the theme object <a id="theme-object" />

As mentioned, with UI Kit v5 we introduced our own theming system dropping the one from MUI. Due to this breaking change it's **no longer possible to solely
rely on MUI to access the `theme` object where all the theme's properties are stored**.

Thus, to access these properties, you now need to import the `theme` object from the `uikit-react-core` package. You can also access them through the `useTheme`
hook also imported from the `core` package. While the values of the former are CSS variables and will be enough in most cases, the later are exact values that you
can use in cases where the usage of CSS variables is not possible. Find more information about the `theme` object and the `useTheme` hook on the
[theming](/docs/guides-theming-theming--theme-context#theming) documentation.

**Note that there is currently an exception and you'll need to continue using the theme object from MUI for [CSS media queries](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/breakpoints/#css-media-queries).**
In future versions we expect these media queries to be added to our own theme but until then use the ones from MUI.

Because of these changes, it's necessary to update the styling MUI utilities used in your application, namely `useTheme`, `withStyles`, and `makeStyles`.
This will be more thoroughly discussed in the [next section](#update-utilities).

Since the theme has a different structure from the one provided on v4.x, find below a mapping of the `theme` object where changes were introduced.

#### Typography

New variants where added to the typography and, when possible, the DS3 variants where mapped to the new DS5 variants as shown above. However, DS3 variants are
still available in cases where mapping was not possible. Learn more about the new variants on the [typography page](/docs/foundation-typography-usage--usage).

#### zIndices

Most of the zIndex values changed on this new version so you'll need to update your application where you were using them using the mapping above.

#### Breakpoints

As mentioned, you'll need to continue using the theme object from MUI to create CSS media queries with the `up`, `down`, `between`, `only`, and `not` utilities.
We expected to add these media queries to our own theme in future versions.

#### Colors

Changes were introduced to the colors in Design System v5.x. To have a better understanding of the changes between DS3 and DS5 report to the
[colors page](/docs/foundation-colors--main) where you can switch between the design systems and to this [table](#colors) where the breaking changes are
highlighted.

Regarding the shadows, you have to explicitly use the value `none` where you were previously using `theme.hv.shadows[0]`. Only the value for `theme.hv.shadows[1]` was
added to theme and you can access it through `theme.colors.shadow` as shown in the table above.

#### Spacing methods

Regarding the spacing methods, we only have one in v5.x when there were previously two in v4.x, `theme.spacing()` and `theme.hvSpacing()`. We decided to combine
both methods and create a `theme.spacing()` method in the new theme object. Note that while the previously base used for the `theme.spacing()` function was 7.5px,
we now use different ones for the DS5 and DS3 themes. Read more about this on this [page](/docs/guides-theming-theming--main#spacing).

### Update styling and theme utilities <a id="update-utilities" />

Due to the breaking changes introduced with UI Kit v5.x, all the MUI's utilities used to access the theme object and style your components must be updated.

Thus, you'll need to:

- Remove MUI's types definitions for the theme;
- Review the `useTheme`, `makeStyles`, and `withStyles` MUI utilities.

#### Remove types definition

You'll need to remove all TypeScript types definitions previously defined for MUI since they are no longer needed.

In your project you most likely have definitions like the one below and they should be removed.

```ts
- declare module "@mui/material/styles" {
-   interface Theme {
-     hv: HvTheme;
-     hvSpacing?: SpacingOptions;
-   }
- }
```

#### Review `useTheme` utility

The theme object returned from MUI's `useTheme` utility is no longer accurate since we dropped MUI's theming system. Thus, to access the theme's properties you'll
need to use the `theme` object imported from `uikit-react-core` as shown below.

```diff
- import { useTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
+ import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

  const Component = () => {
-   const theme = useTheme();
-   const backgroundColor = theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo1;
+   const backgroundColor = theme.colors.atmo1;

    return (...)
  };
```

However, if you are creating CSS media queries through MUI's theme, you must continue to do so since we don't support this feature yet. Find an example below.

```diff
+ import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
  import { useTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
  import { useMediaQuery } from "@mui/material";

  const Component = () => {
-   const theme = useTheme();
+   const muiTheme = useTheme();
-   const isMdUp = useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.up("md"));
+   const isMdUp = useMediaQuery(muiTheme.breakpoints.up("md"));
-   const backgroundColor = theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo1;
+   const backgroundColor = theme.colors.atmo1;

    return (...)
  };
```

Note that the values inside this `theme` object are CSS variables. In some situations it's possible you'll need to use the exact values instead of these variables. In
those cases, you can access the theme context through the `useTheme` hook from the `core` package. Please find an example below.

```diff
- import { useTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
+ import { useTheme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

  const Component = () => {
-   const theme = useTheme();
+   const { selectedMode, activeTheme } = useTheme();
-   const backgroundColor = theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo1;
+   const backgroundColor = activeTheme?.colors.modes[selectedMode].atmo1;

    return (...);
  };
```

#### Keep using `@mui/styles` and update `makeStyles` and `withStyles` utilities

If you want to keep using `@mui/styles` in your project to use the JSS styling system, bear in mind that they are now limitations when using it with UI Kit v5.x.

The `theme` object returned from MUI's utilities can no longer be used to access the theme's variables. Instead this object should be imported from
the `uikit-react-core` package.

##### Update `makeStyles` utility

If you are using the `makeStyles` utility from MUI to style your components in your application, you'll need to update the references to the `theme` object
like shown below.

```diff
+ import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
  import { makeStyles } from "@mui/styles";

- const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
+ const useStyles = makeStyles({
    button: {
-     backgroundColor: theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo1,
+     backgroundColor: theme.colors.atmo1,
    },
- }));
+ });

  export default styles;
```

```diff
import { HvButton } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import useStyles from "./styles";

const CustomButton = ({ buttonLabel }) => {
  const classes = useStyles();

  return <HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
};
```

If you are using MUI's theme object to create CSS media queries, you must continue to do so. Find an example below.

```diff
+ import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
  import { makeStyles } from "@mui/styles";

- const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
+ const useStyles = makeStyles((muiTheme) => ({
    button: {
-     backgroundColor: theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo1,
+     backgroundColor: theme.colors.atmo1,
-     [theme.breakpoints.down("md")]: {
+     [muiTheme.breakpoints.down("md")]: {
        minWidth: 100,
      }
    },
  }));

  export default styles;
```

##### Update `withStyles` utility

If you were previously using the `withStyles` utility to wrap it around higher-order components, you'll also need to update the references to the `theme` object.
However, note that if you are relying on MUI's theme object to create CSS media queries, you must continue to do so.

```diff
+ import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

- const styles = (theme) => ({
+ const styles = () => ({
    button: {
-     backgroundColor: theme.hv.viz.palette.categorical.cviz1,
-     paddingBottom: theme.hv.spacing.sm,
+     backgroundColor: theme.colors.cviz1,
+     paddingBottom: theme.space.sm,
    },
  });

  export default styles;
```

```diff
import { HvButton } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { withStyles } from "@mui/styles";
import styles from "./styles";

const CustomButton = ({ classes, buttonLabel }) => {
  return <HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
};

export default withStyles(styles)(CustomButton);
```

#### Stop using `@mui/styles` and remove `makeStyles` and `withStyles` utilities

If you want to stop using MUI's JSS styling system, you'll need to uninstall `@mui/styles` from your project by running the command below. Ensure that
you are not using this package for other purposes on your project and that you'll only need to use the UI Kit theme object on your application.

```
npm uninstall @mui/styles
```

Then, you'll need to remove all references to the `makeStyles` and `withStyles` utilities.

##### Remove `makeStyles` utility

Removing all references to the `makeStyles` utility implies that you'll need to use another styling method to create custom classes. Since UI Kit is now using Emotion,
we will show you how to do so with `@emotion/css`. However, you are free to use any other styling library/method you want.

```diff
- import { makeStyles } from "@mui/styles";
+ import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
+ import { css } from "@emotion/css";

- const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
+ const styles = {
-   button: {
+   button: css({
-     backgroundColor: theme.hv.palette.atmosphere.atmo1,
+     backgroundColor: theme.colors.atmo1,
-   },
+   }),
- }));
+ };

  export default styles;
```

```diff
- import useStyles from "./styles";
+ import styles from "./styles";
  import { HvButton } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

  const CustomButton = ({ buttonLabel }) => {
-   const classes = useStyles();

-   return <HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
+   return <HvButton className={styles.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
  };
```

##### Remove the `withStyles` utility

The `withStyles` utility can be removed by creating higher-order components with the `styled` utility from Emotion. This will enable you to create reusable components
that can be consumed all over your code. Furthermore, your components can continue to receive classes to override the components' styling.

```diff
+ import { theme, HvButton } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
+ import styled from "@emotion/styled";

- const styles = (theme) => ({
-   button: {
-     backgroundColor: theme.hv.viz.palette.categorical.cviz1,
-     paddingBottom: theme.hv.spacing.sm,
-   },
- });

+ const StyledButton = styled(HvButton)({
+   backgroundColor: theme.colors.cviz1,
+   paddingBottom: theme.space.sm,
+ });

- export default styles;
+ export default StyledButton;
```

```diff
- import { HvButton } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
- import { withStyles } from "@mui/styles";
- import styles from "./styles";
+ import StyledButton from "./styles";

  const CustomButton = ({ classes, buttonLabel }) => {
-   return <HvButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</HvButton>;
+   return <StyledButton className={classes.button}>{buttonLabel}</StyledButton>;
  };

- export default withStyles(styles)(CustomButton);
+ export default CustomButton;
```

## Promoted components <a id="promoted-components" />

In v5.x the components below were promoted from the lab to the core package:

- Inline editor
- Time ago
- Vertical navigation
- Color picker

In order to use them, you'll need to update the necessary imports. Please find an example below.

```diff
-  import { HvTimeAgo } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab"
+  import { HvTimeAgo } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core"
```

## Renamed components and types <a id="renamed-components-types" />

## Breaking changes and deprecated values in components <a id="breaking-changes-deprecated-components" />

### Provider <a id="provider" />

Since we implemented our new theming system, the `HvProvider` API changed significantly. Because of this we recommend that you read the [provider](/docs/guides-provider--main)
and [theming](/docs/guides-theming-theming--main) documentation where the new API is thoroughly explained.

Briefly, the following properties where removed and/or updated:

- `locale`: removed;
- `generateClassNameOptions`: removed;
- `generateClassName`: removed;
- `disableStylesGeneration`: removed;
- `uiKitTheme`: renamed to `colorMode`;
- `theme`: the `themes` property is now used to define your themes and the `theme` only accepts the name of the active theme;
- `changeTheme`: removed from the provider and added to the `useTheme` hook from the `react-core-package`.

### Button <a id="button" />

The `HvButton` API suffered some changes: the `category` property was renamed `variant` and the variants `secondary` and `ghost` are now deprecated. Thus, you
should update these variants to the following values:

- `secondary` to `secondarySubtle`
- `ghost` to `primaryGhost`

Furthermore, the default `variant` is always `primary` even though the button is an icon.

The following `classes` were also removed:

- `icon`
- `ghost`
- `ghostDisabled`
- `primary`
- `primaryDisabled`
- `secondary`
- `secondaryDisabled`
- `semantic`
- `semanticDisabled`

You can have a better overview of the button's API on this [page](/docs/components-button-button--main).

### Typography <a id="typography" />

In DS5, new variants were added to the `HvTypography` component and all the DS3 variants are now considered deprecated. You can still use DS3 variants and,
when possible, they are mapped to a corresponding DS5 variant. However, since the support for these deprecated variants could be removed at any time, we strongly
advise to update them to appropriate DS5 variants.

The `link` and `disabled` properties were also added to the component.

Learn more about the typography variants on this [page](/docs/foundation-typography-usage--usage).

### Card <a id="card" />

The `semantic` property was removed and the border color at the top of the card must be set with the `statusColor` instead.

### Global actions <a id="global-action" />

The properties `backButtonAction`, `backButtonAriaLabel`, and `backwardsIcon` were removed from `HvGlobalActions` and the `backButton` property must be used
instead to pass in the button for the back action.

### Dropdown menu <a id="dropdown-menu" />

The `onToggleOpen` property was removed from the `HvDropdownMenu` and `onToggle` must be used instead. Furthermore, the `disablePortal` is now `true` by default.

### Dot pagination <a id="dot-pagination" />

The `HvDotPagination` component has different specifications for DS3 and DS5. However, due to limitations, it was only possible to implement the component with
the DS5 specifications. Thus, if you are using the DS3 theme on your application, the `HvDotPagination` component will be the one from DS5. However, the new properties
`unselectedIcon` and `selectedIcon` were added to the component in order to easily customize it and meet the DS3 guidelines.
Learn how to do this on this [page](/docs/components-pagination-dot-pagination--customized-dot-pagination).

### Avatar <a id="avatar" />

The `size` property values from the `HvAvatar` component were updated to the values below and the corresponding `classes` were also updated to the same values.

- `XS` to `xs`
- `SM` to `sm`
- `MD` to `md`
- `LG` to `lg`
- `XL` to `xl`

The values `S`, `M`, and `L` were removed since they were already deprecated in previous versions.

The `containerProps` property was removed and a new `avatarProps` property was added. All properties that were previously defined inside `containerProps`
must be directly used on the component. On the other hand, the properties that should be used on the avatar and not the container must now be defined
inside `avatarProps`.

### Panel <a id="panel" />

Since the `HvPanel` component was previously using MUI's `Box` component as its root element it was possible to use CSS properties directly on the
component as properties. This is no longer possible and you must style the panel using the `style`, `classes`, or `className` properties.

```tsx
+ import { css } from "@emotion/css";
  import { HvPanel } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

+ const classes = {
+   panel: css({ maxWidth: "610px", marginTop: "20px", padding: "5px" }),
+ };

  const Component = () => {
    return (
-     <HvPanel maxWidth="610px" marginTop="20px" padding="5px">
+     <HvPanel className={classes.panel}>
        (...)
      </HvPanel>
    );
  };
```

### Vertical navigation <a id="vertical-navigation" />

The properties below were removed from the `HvVerticalNavigation` component since all the logic of opening and closing the navigation should be external
to the component. For example, the `HvVerticalNavigation` could be used inside a drawer component.

- `isCollapsable`
- `isOpen`
- `toggleOpenCallback`
- `position`
- `closeOnExit`
- `buttonAriaLabel`

Then, the open state of the navigation can be set by the new `open` property.

The following `classes` were also removed:

- `noCollapsable`
- `legacyMode`

Furthermore, on the `HvVerticalNavigationTree` component, the following properties were removed:

- `onClick`: Use `onChange` for selection and `onToggle` for node expansion/collapse;
- `label`: Use directly the `aria-label` property instead.

### Table <a id="table" />

The following types and utilities were reviewed and type definitions changes were introduced to enable the definition of the columns' header type:

- `hvTextColumn`
- `hvNumberColumn`
- `hvDateColumn`
- `hvExpandColumn`
- `hvTagColumn`
- `hvSwitchColumn`
- `hvDropdownColumn`
- `hvProgressColumn`
- `useHvTable`
- `useHvData`
- `HvCellProps`
- `HvTableDefinitionConfig`
- `HvTableColumnConfig`
- `HvHooks`
- `HvTableState`
- `HvTableOptions`
- `HvTableColumnOptions`
- `HvTableInstance`
- `HvColumnInstance`
- `HvRowInstance`
- `HvCellInstance`

### Slider <a id="slider" />

The `theme` property was removed since the component accesses the theme object internally.

### Code editor <a id="code-editor" />

The `theme` property was removed since the component accesses the theme object internally.

### Date picker <a id="date-picker" />

The locale must be passed as a prop as the component no longer reads the locale from the provider.

### Color picker <a id="color-picker" />

The properties listed below were added to the color picker component to support the various use cases defined in the DS5 specifications. If you need to
use the DS3 version, the component can easily be customized to meet the guidelines as shown in the example provided in this [story](/docs/lab-color-picker--main#customized-color-picker).

- `placeholder`
- `recommendedColors`
- `recommendedColorsPosition`
- `showLabels`
- `labels`
- `dropdownIcon`
- `iconOnly`
- `showSavedColors`
- `showCustomColors`
- `savedColorsValue`
- `defaultSavedColorsValue`
- `onSavedColorAdded`
- `onSavedColorRemoved`
- `deleteSavedColorButtonArialLabel`
