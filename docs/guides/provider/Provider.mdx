The `HvProvider` component is responsible for the theming capabilities, making cross-component theme properties available down the React tree through React context.

Thus, this component should preferably be used at **the root of your component tree** in order for the theme to be passed down to all components and for the theme
context to be accessible at any point of your application's tree. This component should also be unique in an application in most cases.

You can setup the provider like so:

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return <HvProvider>{children}</HvProvider>;
};
```

The `HvProvider` enables you to define your themes through the `themes` property which accepts a list of themes. Then, the `theme` and `colorMode` properties
are used to specify the active theme and color mode. For more information, please read the [**theming**](./?path=/docs/guides-theming--docs#theming) documentation.

If several `HvProvider`'s are used, you'll need to create different root elements, set the `rootElementId` property for each one of the providers, and scope the
theme styles to the root element with the `cssTheme` property.
Otherwise, the styling will not work properly. Please, find an example below.

**UI Kit components will not work properly if the `HvProvider` is not configured correctly** since they will not be able to access the properties of the active theme.

<Canvas of={ProviderStories.Main} />
<ArgsTable of={HvProvider} />
