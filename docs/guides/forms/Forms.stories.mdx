# Forms

Web forms play a crucial role in web applications, as they are the primary form to collect user information.
By providing a standardised way to capture user input and validat it, we can ensure a consistent user experience across the different applications.

## Form Components

UI Kit provides a set of **Form Components** to build forms. These components have the goals of providing a **consistent React API** to build forms **following the HV Design spec** and
**ease of use and integration with** native HTML form, React forms and form libraries.

The base API of all the form components is established by the **[Form Element](https://lumada-design.github.io/uikit/master/?path=/docs/guides-forms-form-element--docs)** component.
It provides the necessary props to listen to the events, manage the component `status` as well as a `value` prop to make each component **controlled**.

The UI Kit library currently offers the following form components:

- [Checkbox](./?path=/docs/components-checkbox-checkbox--docs) & [Checkbox Group](./?path=/docs/components-checkbox-checkbox-group--docs)
- [Date Picker](./?path=/docs/components-date-picker--docs)
- [Dropdown](./?path=/docs/components-dropdown--docs)
- [Input](./?path=/docs/components-input--docs)
- [Radio Button](./?path=/docs/components-radio-radio--docs) & [Radio Button Group](./?path=/docs/components-radio-radio-group--docs)
- [Search Box](./?path=/docs/components-input-search-box--docs)
- [Selection List](./?path=/docs/components-list-selection-list--docs)
- [Slider](./?path=/docs/components-slider--docs)
- [Switch](./?path=/docs/components-switch--docs)
- [Tags Input](./?path=/docs/components-tag-tags-input--docs)
- [Text Area](./?path=/docs/components-text-area--docs)
- [Time Picker](./?path=/docs/components-time-picker--docs)

## Building forms

In React, form data is usually handled by the components because form elements naturally keep some internal state.  
When doing custom validation or need to access form data you should handle the state with controlled components and control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute.

### Form libraries

When working with React and forms there are a lot of complexities and intricacies that we all struggle with: form verbosity, form validations, and managing the state of the forms and its components.

There are libraries like **[Formik](https://formik.org/)** and **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** that can help you build forms with less pain.  
Both are solving the same problems, and we don't enforce the use of any of them.

Our **Form Components** are compatible with these libraries, but we recommend the use of **imperative set value functions** on each library when handling the onChange event of our components.  
While our APIs are nof fully aligned, this will be the most consistent way of managing the state of the forms and its components.
