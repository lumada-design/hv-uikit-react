# Layout <a id="layout" />

When building UIs you should always strive for **responsive layouts** to enable your pages to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations,
ensuring overall consistency across platforms and environments.

The NEXT UI Kit provides the following components to help you create responsive layouts:

- [Container](#container)
- [Grid](#grid)
- [Simple Grid](#simple-grid)

Using these components together or individually will enable you to create beautiful responsive layouts in your applications.

One underlying concept for all these components are **breakpoints**. While the container and grid components use internally the breakpoints defined by
Design System, the simple grid component enables you to create your own breakpoints. These breakpoints are specific screen sizes at which the layouts
should adjust themselves to suit the screen resolution and orientation.

Design System has the following breakpoints:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: 150 }}>Breakpoint</th>
      <th style={{ width: 150 }}>Width (px)</th>
      <th style={{ width: 150 }}>Gutters (px)</th>
      <th style={{ width: 150 }}>Number of columns</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {Object.entries(getBreakpoints()).map((entry) => {
      return (
        <tr key={entry[0]}>
          <td>{entry[0]}</td>
          <td>{entry[1].value}</td>
          <td>{entry[1].gutter}</td>
          <td>{entry[1].column}</td>
        </tr>
      );
    })}
  </tbody>
</table>

Whenever the screen resolution goes above or below a breakpoint, the layout should adapt itself to suit the screen size and for the content to be accessible.

## Container <a id="container" />

The [Container](./?path=/docs/components-container--docs) is one of the most basic layout components we provide to our community, and it enables you to center content horizontally on the page.

This component is very useful when your content can't grow beyond a specific breakpoint. In this case, you can use `maxWidth` to specify the breakpoint
to which the content is bounded. The content will automatically grow or shrink according with the size of the screen and breakpoint used ensuring that
it doesn't grow beyond the specified width.

If necessary, multiple nested containers can be used as shown in the example below.

## Grid <a id="grid" />

The [Grid](./?path=/docs/components-grid-grid--docs) component enables you to create responsive grid layouts with a variable amount of columns. The grid items will also adapt themselves
to suit the screen sizes.

By default this component is based on a 12-column grid layout. This can be easily changed through the `columns` property. If this property is set to
`auto`, the Design System directives will be used where the number of columns will update depending on the breakpoint.

The grid component also enables you to span items across columns if needed. Thus, with this component you'll be able to create a variety of layouts depending
on your needs.

Below is an example on how to use the grid component where the Design System directives were used and some grid items were spanned across multiple columns.

## Simple Grid <a id="simple-grid" />

The [Simple Grid](./?path=/docs/components-grid-simple-grid--docs) component is an alternative to the grid component mentioned above and it provides an easy way of creating responsive grids where each item takes an equal amount
of space. The items will grow or shrink whenever the screen size changes.

This component should be used whenever you need to create grids where items should be distributed across a specific number of columns with the same width.

This component also enables you to create your own breakpoints and define the spacing and number of columns for each one. Thus, contrary to the grid component,
the simple grid does not rely on the Design System breakpoints. Furthermore, you can only define the number of columns per row and not the span of each grid item
enabling you to create much simpler grids than the grid component.

In the example below a grid with three columns was created to distribute the cards across them, and when the screen width goes under the Design System
`sm` (600px) breakpoint the grid only has two columns.
