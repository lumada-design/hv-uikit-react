# White Labeling

A major feature of the NEXT UI Kit is white labeling. This feature enhances the customization capabilities in a way that enables you to keep
using the UI Kit in a multitude of design scenarios when there's a need to meet different UI guidelines from the NEXT Design System. Thus, it's possible to
customize the current Design System patterns in order to meet specific client's needs.

This feature has some limitations since it doesn't allow to change the chore structure of a component. What you are able to do is customize
specific properties of a component as well as global properties of the theme. This will be enough in most cases and is on its own very powerful since
one small change can drastically change an entire application.

The white labeling customizations can be implemented at the theme level with the `createTheme` utility. With this utility you are able to create a new theme based on
one of the default Design System themes (DS3 or DS5) by customizing its global properties, such as font family, colors, shadows, among others, and specific properties
of the components.

The [theming](./?path=/docs/guides-theming--docs#theming) documentation offers more detailed information on the default themes' structures and
the properties that are customizable as well as the `createTheme` utility.

The example below clearly shows how a theme from the NEXT Design System can be customized to meet different UI guidelines.

```tsx
import {
  createTheme,
  HvProvider,
  theme,
} from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const turquoiseTheme = createTheme({
  name: "turquoise",
  base: "ds5",
  inheritColorModes: true,
  colors: {
    modes: {
      dawn: { secondary: "#484349", primary: "#18A999" },
    },
  },
  fontFamily: {
    body: "Gill Sans",
  },
  button: { hoverColor: "#ecfcfa" },
  header: {
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary,
    color: "#F6F8FF",
    brandColor: "#F6F8FF",
    height: "60px",
    hoverColor: "transparent",
    selectedItemColor: "#F6F8FF",
    selectedItemBackgroundColor: theme.colors.secondary,
    selectedItemBorderTopColor: "transparent",
    selectedItemBorderTopThickness: "0px",
    selectedItemBorderBottomColor: "transparent",
    selectedItemBorderBottomThickness: "0px",
    selectedItemBorderRadius: theme.radii.full,
    itemPadding: theme.space.xs,
  },
});

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return <HvProvider themes={[turquoiseTheme]}>{children}</HvProvider>;
};
```

Only by customizing the theme, the `HvHeader`, `HvButton`, `HvHeaderBrand`, `HvHeaderNavigation`, `HvGlobalActions`, `HvTypography`, and `HvContainer`
components were able change their default styling.

<Unstyled>
  <WhiteLabeling />
</Unstyled>

Implementing deeper customizations to an element than the ones presented above requires you to use others types of customization.
For more information on how you can customize components, report to the [customization](./?path=/docs/guides-styling--docs#customization) documentation.
