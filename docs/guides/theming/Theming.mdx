## Default themes <a id="default-themes" />

The theme is the cornerstone of all components and it comprises all the styling specifications for the components, such as colors, font sizes, shadows, spacings,
among others.

The NEXT UI Kit provides two default themes compliant with the Design System. In this sense, the components are supported for the **Design System 3 and 5**.
Each one of these versions has a specific theme with two different color modes: **Dawn**, a light theme, and **Wicked**, a dark theme.

<Unstyled>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "10px" }}>
    <div id="hv-ds5-dawn">
      <HvProvider
        classNameKey="hv-ds-five-dawn"
        rootElementId="hv-ds5-dawn"
        cssTheme="scoped"
        colorMode="dawn"
      >
        <ThemeSample title="Design System 5 - Dawn" />
      </HvProvider>
    </div>
    <div id="hv-ds5-wicked">
      <HvProvider
        classNameKey="hv-ds-five-wicked"
        rootElementId="hv-ds5-wicked"
        cssTheme="scoped"
        colorMode="wicked"
      >
        <ThemeSample title="Design System 5 - Wicked" />
      </HvProvider>
    </div>
    <div id="hv-ds3-dawn">
      <HvProvider
        classNameKey="hv-ds-three-dawn"
        rootElementId="hv-ds3-dawn"
        cssTheme="scoped"
        themes={[ds3]}
        colorMode="dawn"
      >
        <ThemeSample title="Design System 3 - Dawn" />
      </HvProvider>
    </div>
    <div id="hv-ds3-wicked">
      <HvProvider
        classNameKey="hv-ds-three-wicked"
        rootElementId="hv-ds3-wicked"
        cssTheme="scoped"
        themes={[ds3]}
        colorMode="wicked"
      >
        <ThemeSample title="Design System 3 - Wicked" />
      </HvProvider>
    </div>
  </div>
</Unstyled>

Although these two themes are provided out of the box and will most likely be sufficient in most cases, you have the complete freedom to customize these themes by
creating your own ones depending on your design needs and requirements.

## Theme structure <a id="theme-structure" />

Find below the structure and values for each one of the default themes. Both themes have the same structure and only the values differ.

<Unstyled>
  <ThemeStructure />
</Unstyled>

## Theme configuration <a id="theme-configuration" />

The themes you want to support in your application can be defined through the `HvProvider`'s `themes` property. This property accepts a list of themes, namely
themes you created and/or the default themes provided by the NEXT UI Kit. If no value is provided to the `themes` property, UI Kit will use the DS5 theme by default.

The default themes can be imported from the `uikit-react-core` package. On the other hand, an utility called `createdTheme` is also available in the core package
to help you create new themes.

The `createdTheme` utility accepts an object that enables you to create a brand new theme based on one of the default themes and by defining customizations
to meet your specific design needs. Thus, with this utility, you are able to create new color modes and/or customize a default theme by overriding the current
styling values.

The `createdTheme` utility accepts an object with the following properties:

| Property                                                             | Definition                                                                                              | Type                                                                  | Default |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `base`                                                               | The name of the default theme to be used as base for the new theme.                                     | `ds5` or `ds3`                                                        | `ds5`   |
| `name*`                                                              | The name of the new theme.                                                                              | `string`                                                              | -       |

| Any property from the default themes structure or any extra property | Customizations of the default themes structure properties or extra properties to be added to the theme. | \* The complete structure of the default themes object is shown above | -       |

### Initialize the UI Kit theme and color mode

Using one of the default themes and their color modes is as simple as setting the `themes`, `theme`, and `colorMode` properties of the `HvProvider`.

The `theme` property is used to set the active theme and it accepts the name of one of themes passed to `themes`. The `colorMode` property is used to
set the active color mode and accepts the name of one of the color modes of the active theme.

In the example below, the `themes`, `theme`, and `colorMode` properties were not set. Thus, in this case, the `ds5` theme and the `dawn` color mode will
be used by default.

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => <HvProvider>{children}</HvProvider>;
```

In the following example, the `colorMode` property was set in order to specify the color mode to be used. Since the `themes` property is not set, the theme will
default to `ds5`. For this theme, the following color modes are available: `wicked` and `dawn`.

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => (
  <HvProvider colorMode="wicked">{children}</HvProvider>
);
```

However, let's say you want to use the `ds3` theme. In this case, you'll need to import it from the `uikit-react-core` package and pass it to the `themes` property
as shown in the example below. The `colorMode` can then be set to one of the `ds3` color modes: `wicked` and `dawn`. If the `colorMode` property is not defined,
the color mode will default to `dawn`.

```tsx
import { ds3, HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => (
  <HvProvider themes={[ds3]} colorMode="dawn">
    {children}
  </HvProvider>
);
```

In the example shown above, it was not necessary to set the `theme` property since only one theme was provided to `themes`. However, if more than one theme is provided,
the `theme` property should be set to the name of the active theme.

In the example below, the `ds3` and `ds5` themes are provided to the `HvProvider`, and the UI Kit is initialized with the `ds3` theme and `dawn` color mode.
If `theme` and `colorMode` were not set, the active theme would be the first theme from `themes`. The active color mode would also resolve to the first color
mode defined in the active theme, which is the `dawn` color mode for `ds3` and `ds5`.

```tsx
import { ds3, ds5, HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => (
  <HvProvider themes={[ds3, ds5]} theme="ds3" colorMode="dawn">
    {children}
  </HvProvider>
);
```

### Create a new theme

Besides the default themes provided by the NEXT UI Kit, you can create a brand new theme to meet your specific design needs and pass it to the `themes` property.
As mentioned, the `createTheme` utility is used to create a new theme.

The `createTheme` utility requires you to name your theme. In the example below, the name chosen was `myTheme`. Then, the DS5 theme was used as base for the new theme,
and we chose not inherit the DS5 color modes and instead create a new one called `sand`. For this new color mode, some colors were customized. All other colors will
be set to the ones from the base theme `dawn` color mode. Finally, the font family was also customize to Courier New instead of Open Sans.

```tsx
import {
  createTheme,
  HvProvider,
  HvTypography,
} from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const newTheme = createTheme({
  name: "myTheme",
  base: "ds5",
  inheritColorModes: false,
  colors: {
    modes: {
      sand: {
        backgroundColor: "#EAE7DC",
        positive: "#738f54",
        neutral: "#7699b8",
        warning: "#d9905f",
        negative: "#bf6060",
        neutral_20: "#a4aeba",
        positive_20: "#b2bda6",
        negative_20: "#d19090",
        primary: "#536f8f",
        primary_80: "#76a6db",
      },
    },
  },
  fontFamily: {
    body: "Courier New",
  },
});

const MyApp = () => (
  <HvProvider themes={[newTheme]}>
    <HvTypography>Hello from the UI Kit team!</HvTypography>
  </HvProvider>
);
```

<Story of={ThemingStories.CreateTheme} />

There is not a limit to the number of themes you can pass to the `themes` property and you can use new themes as well as the default ones. Just make sure they all
have different names. If a name is used more than once, only the one that appears last in the `themes` list will remain.

Besides overriding values from the base theme, you can also add new properties to the theme if you need to. In the example below, a new color called `green` was added
to the `dawn` and `wicked` color modes.

```tsx
import { createTheme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const newTheme = createTheme({
  name: "myTheme",
  base: "ds5",
  inheritColorModes: true,
  colors: {
    modes: {
      dawn: {
        green: "#738f54",
      },
      wicked: {
        green: "#738f54",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use the value from these new properties, you need to access the theme context as explained in more detail in the next section.

## Theme context <a id="theme-context" />

The `uikit-react-core` package exposes a `useTheme` that provides access to the properties of the theme context, namely:

- `selectedTheme`: name of the active theme;
- `selectedMode`: name of the active color mode;
- `colorModes`: list of color modes available for the active theme;
- `themes`: list of the available themes;
- `rootId`: id of the root element where the theme styles are being applied if scoped;
- `colors`: object with the active color mode's colors;
- `activeTheme`: object with the active theme;
- `changeTheme`: method to change the active theme and color mode.

### Change the active theme and color mode

The active theme and/or color mode can be changed with the `changeTheme` method as shown in the example below.

```tsx
import { HvButton, useTheme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { ThemeSwitcher } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-icons";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { selectedTheme, selectedMode, changeTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <HvButton
      icon
      variant="secondaryGhost"
      onClick={() =>
        changeTheme(selectedTheme, selectedMode === "dawn" ? "wicked" : "dawn")
      }
    >
      <ThemeSwitcher />
    </HvButton>
  );
};
```

### Access the active theme

If you want to access the theme's colors, you can do as shown below.

<Canvas of={ThemingStories.ThemeContext} />

## CSS variables <a id="css-variables" />

All properties from the NEXT UI Kit default themes are available as CSS variables. Each one of these variables has the prefix `uikit` and can easily be
accessed through the `theme` object that can be imported from the `uikit-react-core` package.

Find below an example on how this `theme` object can be used to style your application.

<Canvas of={ThemingStories.CssVariables} />

## Default Props <a id="default-props" />

Through our theme it is also possible to change the default props of a component. Let's say for example that the theme you want only uses squared
shape avatars, you can use this feature to make your life easier by pre defining the default value of the prop `variant` to `square` in the `theme` `components` section like so:

This allows us to not have to declare that property every time we use the component.
One of the big benefits of this is that most of all of our components have a `classes` prop. This means that we can now customize all
of the components by overwriting their classes through the theme object.

<Canvas of={ThemingStories.DefaultProps} />

## Theme utilities <a id="theme-utils" />

### Spacing <a id="spacing" />

The NEXT UI Kit provides a spacing helper function named `spacing`. This function helps generate the spacing values for the UI elements when required
and is contained within the `theme` object provided by the `uikit-react-core` package.

This helper function receives any number of arguments (or an array of arguments), where each argument is either:

- A `number`, which is then multiplied by the `8px` base value;
- A `string`, which is either converted to their breakpoint value (`xs`,`sm`,`md`,`lg`,`xl`) or left as-is.

Examples:

```tsx
theme.spacing(2); // 16px (2*8px)
theme.spacing(1, 0); // 8px 0px

theme.spacing("sm"); // 16px
theme.spacing("sm", "inherit", "42px"); // 16px inherit 42px
```

The spacing base and breakpoints for each default theme are shown below.

```tsx
// DS5
const ds5Spaces = {
  base: 8,
  xs: "8px",
  sm: "16px",
  md: "24px",
  lg: "48px",
  xl: "80px",
};

// DS3
const ds3Spaces = {
  base: 10,
  xs: "10px",
  sm: "20px",
  md: "30px",
  lg: "60px",
  xl: "90px",
};
```

Find below an example on how to use the spacing helper function.

<Canvas of={ThemingStories.Spacing} />

### Alpha colors <a id="alpha-colors" />

An alpha helper function named `alpha` is also provided and contained within the `theme` object exported by the `uikit-react-core` package.
This utility function accepts a color name from the theme and an alpha value and applies the transparency to the color.

Example:

```tsx
theme.alpha("primary", 0.5); // applies a transparency of 50% to the primary color
```

Find an example below.

<Canvas of={ThemingStories.Alpha} />
