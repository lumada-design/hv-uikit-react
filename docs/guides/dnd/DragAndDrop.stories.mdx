# Drag and Drop

<Meta title="Guides/Drag and Drop" />

For UI Kit users that want to use drag and drop functionality, the UI Kit team recommends the [@dnd-kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/) library
for its performance, accessibility and extensibility. We strongly recommend checking their documentation.

All the code for the samples in this section can be found [in our repository](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/tree/master/docs/guides/dnd).

## Sortable List

This sample showcases a scenario where we have a single column and we want to drag items within this column. You can drag the items
by their handle or by using the keyboard. In this case you just have to tab your way to the item and press the `Space` key (or `Enter`)
to select it and then use the arrows to move the item to its new place Then just press `Space` again to release it.

## Multiple Containers

In this sample we showcase how to use drag and drop between different containers.

  <Story name="Dnd Kit Multiple Columns" story={DndKitMultipleStory} />

## Native Drag and Drop

If you don't want to use any external libraries you can still achieve a similar result by using plain Javascript.

  <Story name="Vanilla Javascript" story={VanillaStory} />
