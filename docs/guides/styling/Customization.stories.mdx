# Customization <a id="customization" />

Even though all components are compliant with the Design System specifications, it is expected you'll need to customize them in order to meet your specific needs.
In this sense, the UI Kit components can be customized the following ways:

- [Single instance customization](#single-instance-customization)
- [Reusable components](#reusable-components)
- [Theme override](#theme-override)
- [Global override](#global-override)

## Single instance customization <a id="single-instance-customization" />

Find below the ways you have at your disposal to style a single instance of a component.

### Inline styles

You can style a component by applying inline styles using the `style` property. The value passed must be a JavaScript object with all
properties in camel case format.

```tsx
import { HvButton, theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <HvButton
    variant="secondaryGhost"
    onClick={() => {}}
    style={{ backgroundColor: theme.colors.sema3 }}
  >
    Click me!
  </HvButton>
);
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="InlineStyles">
    <InlineStyles />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Custom classes

#### Using the `className` property

It's also possible to customize a component providing a custom class to the `className` property.

One way of doing this is by creating your custom class inside a CSS file as follows:

```css
// CustomButton.css file

.custom-button {
  color: rosybrown;
}
```

Then, you need to import the CSS file and use the custom class you created on the `className` property.

```tsx
// CustomButton.tsx file

import "./CustomButton.css";
import { HvButton } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <HvButton
    variant="secondaryGhost"
    onClick={() => {}}
    className="custom-button"
  >
    Click me!
  </HvButton>
);
```

It's also possible to use **Emotion** to achieve the same result using the `css` utility as shown in the example below.

```tsx
import { HvButton, theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { css } from "@emotion/css";

const classes = {
  customButton: css({ color: theme.colors.sema6 }),
};

const MyComponent = () => (
  <HvButton
    variant="secondaryGhost"
    onClick={() => {}}
    className={classes.customButton}
  >
    Click me!
  </HvButton>
);
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Override ClassName">
    <OverrideClassName />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

##### Nested classes

For each component, class names are provided to help you target specific parts of a component. Thus, all components can be customized by creating
selectors that targets these class names. All classes begin with the name of the component they belong to.

In order to understand in more detail where these class names are being used, you'll need to use the browser's developer tools. Once you identify the
classes you want to override, you can target them in your CSS by creating a selector.

In the example below, a selector was created to change the color of the indicator used on the selected tab.

```tsx
import {
  HvTabs,
  HvTab,
  tabsClasses,
  theme,
} from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { css } from "@emotion/css";

const classes = {
  tabsIndicator: css({
    [`& .${tabsClasses.indicator}`]: {
      "& > div": {
        backgroundColor: theme.colors.sema1,
      },
    },
  }),
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  const handleChange = (_, newValue) => {
    setValue(newValue);
  };

  return (
    <HvTabs
      value={value}
      onChange={handleChange}
      className={classes.tabsIndicator}
    >
      <HvTab label="Tab 1" />
      <HvTab label="Tab 2" />
    </HvTabs>
  );
};
```

#### Using the `classes` property

Most UI Kit components have a `classes` property that exposes several classes that are used internally in the component. These classes can then be overridden from the outside by providing a custom class name.
To create a custom class name you can use one of the patterns that were shown above.

Find below an example on how to override the `classes` property of a component. In this example, we are overriding the style of the `HvSwitch`'s label.

```tsx
import { HvSwitch } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { css } from "@emotion/css";

const classes = {
  label: css({ textTransform: "uppercase" }),
};

const MyComponent = () => (
  <HvSwitch
    id="override-classes-switch-id"
    label="Switch"
    classes={{
      label: classes.label,
    }}
  />
);
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Override Classes">
    <OverrideClasses />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

This way of styling components is very convenient since it allows you to easily access classes of internal components and style them. For example, UI Kit's `HvDropDownMenu` component internally uses a UI Kit `HvButton` with an icon that can be styled through the `icon` and `iconSelected` classes.

```tsx
<HvDropDownMenu
  classes={{
    root: classes.dropDownMenu,
    icon: classes.dropDownMenuButton,
    iconSelected: classes.dropDownMenuButtonSelected,
  }}
  (...)
/>
```

## Reusable components <a id="reusable-components" />

In order to have a cleaner and more maintainable code, you should always strive to promote code reusability by creating reusable components.

To achieve this, you can use the `styled` utility from Emotion as shown in the example below. In this example, we are overriding UI Kit's `HvButton`.

```tsx
import { HvButton, HvButtonProps } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const StyledHvButton = styled(HvButton)({
  textTransform: "uppercase",
});

export const ReusableComponent = (props: HvButtonProps) => (
  <StyledHvButton {...props} />
);
```

Then, you can import the component and use it like so:

```tsx
<ReusableComponent>Click me!</ReusableComponent>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Reusable Component">
    <ReusableComponent id="reusable-button-id">Click me!</ReusableComponent>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Dynamic styles

The Emotion's `styled` utility also enables you to override a component's style based on its properties.

To achieve this, take a look at the example below where the `HvButton`'s label changes color based on the `variant` property.

```tsx
import {
  HvButton,
  HvButtonProps,
  theme,
} from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const StyledHvButton = styled(HvButton)(({ variant }: HvButtonProps) => ({
  color: variant === "secondaryGhost" ? theme.colors.sema1 : theme.colors.sema4,
}));

const ReusableComponent = (props: HvButtonProps) => (
  <StyledHvButton {...props} />
);
```

Then, you can use the component the following way:

```tsx
<ReusableComponent variant="secondaryGhost">Secondary ghost!</ReusableComponent>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dynamic Reusable Component">
    <DynamicReusableComponent
      id="dynamic-reusable-button-sg-id"
      variant="secondaryGhost"
    >
      Secondary ghost!
    </DynamicReusableComponent>
    <DynamicReusableComponent
      id="dynamic-reusable-button-pg-id"
      variant="primaryGhost"
    >
      Primary ghost!
    </DynamicReusableComponent>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Theme override <a id="theme-override" />

Components can also be styled by providing customizations to them through the theme with the `createTheme` utility. Customizing components using this method enables
to change specific parts of a component at a global scale in your application applying these changes to all instances of the component.

Only very specific properties of a component can be customized using the `createTheme` utility varying from component to component.
Overtime time we will work toward providing more customizable properties for components. However, at the moment, only some components can be customized
through the theme. For more information, please read the [theming](/docs/guides-theming-theming--main#theme-structure) documentation where a structure of the theme with
the components that are customizable is provided.

In the example below, the border radius and background color of the `HvCard` component was customized.

```tsx
import {
  createTheme,
  HvProvider,
  HvCard,
  HvCardHeader,
  HvCardContent,
  HvTypography,
} from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const newTheme = createTheme({
  name: "myTheme",
  base: "ds5",
  inheritColorModes: true,
  card: {
    borderRadius: "0px 0px 20px 20px",
    backgroundColor: "#fbfaf8",
  },
});

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <HvProvider themes={[newTheme]}>
      <HvCard selectable>
        <HvCardHeader title="NEXT UI Kit" subheader="React UI library" />
        <HvCardContent>
          <HvTypography>Hello from the team!</HvTypography>
        </HvCardContent>
      </HvCard>
    </HvProvider>
  );
};
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Theme Override">
    <ThemeOverride />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Global override <a id="global-override" />

The components can also be customized by overriding global properties of the theme that are used by various elements throughout the application such as colors,
font sizes, shadows, spaces, among others.

This type of customization is very powerful since one small change can drastically change an application.

The example below shows how the `HvTypography` and `HvButton` components can be customized only by overriding the theme's font family and the value for the
`acce1` color.

```tsx
import {
  createTheme,
  HvProvider,
  HvCard,
  HvCardHeader,
  HvCardContent,
  HvTypography,
} from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const newTheme = createTheme({
  name: "myTheme",
  base: "ds5",
  inheritColorModes: true,
  colors: {
    modes: {
      dawn: { acce1: "#bf6060" },
    },
  },
  fontFamily: {
    body: "Courier New",
  },
});

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <HvProvider themes={[newTheme]}>
      <HvTypography>Hello from the UI Kit team.</HvTypography>
      <HvButton variant="secondaryGhost">Click me!</HvButton>
    </HvProvider>
  );
};
```
