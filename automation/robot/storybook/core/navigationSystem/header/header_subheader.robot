*** Comments ***
dev implementation keep items always visible and enabled although human eye it is not visible.
Because of that the below test cases just can be validated on image recognition tests
- closes/hide subheader when mouse hover out of child item 
- closes/hide subheader when a child item is selected and mouse hover item that has not child items
