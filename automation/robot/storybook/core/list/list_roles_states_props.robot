...    - If the complete set of available options is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading as the user scrolls, their aria-setsize and aria-posinset attributes are set appropriately. 
...    - If options are arranged horizontally, the element with role listbox has aria-orientation set to horizontal. The default value of aria-orientation for listbox is vertical.
