## Next Major Release (Early Second Quarter 2020)
We are actively planning and starting to work on the next major release. This development will happen in the branch called `next` and we will provide builds as soon as possible. 
For more information about the schedule please check the Release Schedule section under Discover More. 

#### These are features planned for the next release:
- upgrade our main dependency Material UI to its latest version 4.x.
- api cleanup, removing deprecated properties of our components.
- remove deprecated components (core and lab).
- better support for Typescript.

If you want to keep up to date with the progress on these topics, please feel free to check the [2.0.0 Milestone](https://github.com/pentaho/hv-uikit-react/milestone/13).

#### npm registry
Our packages are being published to a public npm registry. If you want to use this project please make sure you have _.npmrc_ config file with one of the following lines:

```
If you want to use it for UI-KIT dependencies
@hv:registry=https://nexus.pentaho.org/repository/group-npm/

Or if you want to use it for all dependencies
registry=https://nexus.pentaho.org/repository/group-npm/
```
Please check that your npmrc has this by running `npm config ls -l`, otherwise you can add it to the config by running `npm config edit`, otherwise the installation step below will not work.

### Installation
  - core - ```npm install @hv/uikit-react-core```
  - lab - ```npm install @hv/uikit-react-lab```
  - icons - ```npm install @hv/uikit-react-icons```

To always have the latest development version of the UIkit, even before a release, you may want to use npm with the `latest` tag.

#### global link
If you need to work on a component and watch the changes reflected on your application at the same time, you can [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html) your packages globally:

```bash
npm run link
```

It will create a symlink in the global folder {prefix}/lib/node_modules/<package> for each package.

### Getting Started
Install root dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

#### bootstrap

Bootstrap the packages in the current repo. Installs all their dependencies and links any cross-dependencies.

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

#### doc

It will startup the UI Development Environment [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). There you can see a list of the available components.

```bash
npm run doc
```

#### documentation
