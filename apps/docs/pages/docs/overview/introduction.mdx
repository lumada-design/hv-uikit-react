# Introduction

NEXT UI Kit is **Hitachi Vantara** open source React component library for products and digital solutions.

With the **[NEXT Design System](https://designsystem.hitachivantara.com/)** as its foundation, it provides a collection of reusable React components, that guarantees the alignment with the design specifications, and stands as a catalyser for a consistent overall user experience across Hitachi portfolio.​

NEXT UI Kit provides developers with the tools they need to build more product in less time, while saving them from the mind-numbing work of creating the same base components over and over again.

## Guiding principles

**NEXT UI Kit builds consistency**. Every element and component was built to have an intuitive and familiar API to boost development experience and ensure consistent and cohesive user experiences.

**NEXT UI Kit is modular and flexible**. The system’s modularity ensures maximum flexibility, allowing developers to easily integrate individual components seamlessly with each other.

**NEXT UI Kit is customizable**. It includes a variety of customization options, allowing developers to tailor the UI to match their design needs.

**NEXT UI Kit is inclusive**. It’s designed and built to be accessible to all, regardless of any physical or cognitive impairments.

## Accessibility

We target our development and tests to meet [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) standards.  
Since many of our components are custom built, there might be areas where the accessibility of a component can be improved.
If there is any component where you think improvements can be made, please reach out to us.

Even though we're focused on developing a component library that is compliant with these standards, the application in which the components are integrated into has the responsibility of ensuring that the individual components are configured correctly and that the integration of those components produce an accessible application.
