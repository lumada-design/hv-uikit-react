# Get Started

If you're starting a new project, we recommend you follow the [**Automation setup**](#automatic-setup) instructions.
If you're adding UI Kit to an existing project, follow the [**Manual setup**](#manual-setup).

## Automatic setup

NEXT UI Kit offers an interactive command-line tool to easily bootstrap new projects, [**hv-uikit-cli**](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-cli/).
Follow [this link](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-cli/#usage) for usage documentation.

```sh
npx @hitachivantara/hv-uikit-cli@latest create
```

## Manual setup

### Installation

NEXT UI Kit uses [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) as its default styling engine and [MUI](https://mui.com/) as a core dependency.

To use NEXT UI Kit in your project, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-core @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/material
```

`react` and `react-dom` are peer dependencies and must be included in your project. We currently support versions `17.x` and `18.x`.

```sh
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
```

### Usage

#### 1. Set up the provider

After installing the core package, you'll need to setup the `HvProvider`, which can be imported from `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core`,
and wrap your application with it like so:

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return <HvProvider>{children}</HvProvider>;
};
```

This will initialize the UI Kit with the `Design System 5` theme and the `dawn` color mode by default. Depending on your design requirements, you may need to customize or use other themes.

For more information, please report to the [**provider**](/docs/guides/provider)
and [**theming**](/docs/guides/theming) documentation.

#### 2. Load the default font

The UI Kit uses **Open Sans** as its default font family since it is the one defined by the Design System specifications. Thus, you'll need to ensure the font
is loaded properly since the UI Kit can't do it automatically.

This can be achieved through the **Google Web Fonts CDN** by using the following code inside your project's `<head>` tag:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,600"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Please, report to the [**typography**](/docs/foundation/typography) documentation for more information.

#### 3. Use the components

After setting up the provider and load the font, you can start using the components provided by the UI Kit core package like so:

```tsx
import { HvTypography } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <HvTypography>Hello from the UI Kit team!</HvTypography>;
};
```
