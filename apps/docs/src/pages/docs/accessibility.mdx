# Accessibility

We strive to ensure our component library adheres to accessibility best practices by aligning development and testing efforts
with [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and
[Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) standards.

Many of our components are custom-built, which means we pay special attention to keyboard support, screen reader compatibility,
and ARIA attributes. However, we recognize that accessibility is an ongoing process. If you notice any areas where a component's
accessibility could be improved, we welcome your feedback â€” please don't hesitate to reach out.

While we aim to deliver accessible components, the responsibility for ensuring overall accessibility ultimately lies with the
applications that use them. Proper configuration, context-appropriate usage, and thoughtful integration are key to creating
accessible user experiences.

## Keyboard Navigation

Most of our components support keyboard navigation, allowing users to interact with them using the keyboard. This includes
navigating through items, selecting options, and performing actions without relying solely on a mouse or touch input.

Here are some examples of standard keyboard interactions you can expect from our components:

| Key               | Action                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Buttons           | `Enter` or `Space` to activate                                                 |
| Modals            | `Esc` to close                                                                 |
| Tabs              | `Arrow keys` to navigate between tabs, `Tab` to move focus                     |
| Dropdowns         | `Enter` or `Space` to select, `Arrow keys` to navigate options, `Esc` to close |
| Checkboxs, Radios | `Space` to toggle selection                                                    |
| Groups            | `Arrow keys` to navigate between items, `Tab` to move focus                    |

## ARIA and Role Customization

Most components expose props to enhance or override accessibility settings. You can:

- Pass aria-label, aria-labelledby, or aria-describedby
- Override the default role if needed
- Control aria-expanded, aria-checked, and other dynamic attributes through props

We recommend referring to [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) when customizing accessibility behavior.
