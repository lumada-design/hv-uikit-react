# Color Tokens

Color tokens are the **semantic layer** of the **UI Kit** color system, providing **consistent**, and **themeable** values for UI development.
They ensure design integrity, maintainability, and seamless alignment between design and implementation.

<Callout type="info">
  Think of color tokens as the handshake between design and development. They
  keep everyone on the same page â€” so always use them to ensure things stay
  consistent and clean.
</Callout>

Color tokens can be accessed through the `theme.colors` object:

```tsx
import { theme } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div style={{ color: theme.colors.primary }}>
    This text uses the semantic primary color.
  </div>
);
```
