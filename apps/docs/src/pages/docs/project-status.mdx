# Project Status

**UI Kit** is actively maintained by a dedicated team committed to enabling high-quality digital product development. Stay informed about the project’s current status and ongoing development.

## Design System Support

Originally built on the [Next Design System](https://designsystem.hitachivantara.com/6c705d900/p/43c9a1-next-design-system), **UI Kit** has since evolved into a **design system–agnostic** library, powered by a flexible [theming system](/docs/theming) that allows teams to meet diverse branding and design requirements.

Recent development has focused on supporting the **Pentaho+ Design System**, so updates related to the **NEXT Design System** may take longer to be fully reflected in the current **UI Kit** version.

While we recognize this may impact teams depending on NEXT DS alignment, we also see it as a valuable opportunity for collaboration. If your team depends on NEXT DS or is interested in helping advance compatibility, the **UI Kit** team is happy to:

- Walk through the current codebase and roadmap
- Understand your design system and theming requirements
- Support your contribution or integration efforts

To get involved, [open an issue](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/issues/new) or reach out through our channels.
