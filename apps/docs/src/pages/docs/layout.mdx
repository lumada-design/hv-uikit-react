# Layout

When building UIs you should always strive for **responsive layouts** to enable your pages to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations,
ensuring overall consistency across platforms and environments.

The NEXT UI Kit provides the following components to help you create responsive layouts:

- [Container](#container)
- [Grid](#grid)
- [Simple Grid](#simple-grid)

One underlying concept for all these components are **breakpoints**. While the container and grid components use internally the breakpoints defined by
the Design System, the simple grid component enables you to create your own breakpoints. These breakpoints are specific screen sizes at which the layouts
should adjust themselves to suit the screen resolution and orientation.

The breakpoints defined by the Design System are:

| Breakpoint | Width (px) | Gutters (px) | Number of columns |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| xs         | 0          | 16           | 4                 |
| sm         | 600        | 16           | 8                 |
| md         | 960        | 32           | 12                |
| lg         | 1270       | 32           | 12                |
| xl         | 1920       | 32           | 12                |

Whenever the screen resolution goes above or below a breakpoint, the layout should adapt itself to suit the screen size and for the content to be accessible.

## Container

The [`HvContainer`](/components/container) is one of the most basic layout components we provide to our community, and it enables you to center content horizontally on the page.

This component is very useful when your content can't grow beyond a specific breakpoint. In this case, you can use `maxWidth` to specify the breakpoint
to which the content is bounded. The content will automatically grow or shrink according with the size of the screen and breakpoint used ensuring that
it doesn't grow beyond the specified width.

```tsx live
<HvContainer maxWidth="sm">
  <HvGlobalActions title="Details" />

  <HvTypography variant="body">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Corrupti quasi sed
    perferendis optio eos excepturi possimus atque aperiam impedit expedita
    dolores, est nulla, aut iure, deleniti recusandae corporis eaque provident?
  </HvTypography>
  <HvTypography variant="body">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Velit culpa error
    vitae fugit minima. Distinctio tempore ipsa voluptatum, vel alias possimus
    aut, itaque corrupti nesciunt accusantium commodi nulla minima voluptates.
  </HvTypography>
</HvContainer>
```

## Grid

The [`HvGrid`](/components/grid) component enables you to create responsive grid layouts with a variable amount of columns. The grid items will also adapt themselves
to suit the screen sizes.

By default this component is based on a 12-column grid layout. This can be easily changed through the `columns` property. If this property is set to
`auto`, the Design System directives will be used where the number of columns will update depending on the breakpoint.

The grid component also enables you to span items across columns if needed. Thus, with this component you'll be able to create a variety of layouts depending
on your needs.

Below is an example on how to use the grid component where the Design System directives were used and some grid items were spanned across multiple columns.

```tsx live
<HvGrid columns="auto" container>
  <HvGrid item xs={4} sm={8} md={12}>
    <HvGlobalActions title="Dashboard" />
  </HvGrid>
  {Array.from({ length: 4 }).map((v, i) => {
    return (
      <HvGrid item xs={4} sm={4} md={3} lg={3} key={i}>
        <HvCard
          statusColor={i === 0 ? "warning" : "positive"}
          bgcolor="bgContainer"
        >
          <HvCardContent className="grid gap-sm pb-xs!">
            <div className="flex items-center gap-xxs">
              <HvIconContainer
                size="xs"
                className="p-4px rounded-round bg-bgContainerSecondary border border-borderSubtle"
              >
                <div className="i-ph-copy-simple" />
              </HvIconContainer>
              <HvTypography variant="title3">KPI {i + 1}</HvTypography>
            </div>
            <div className="flex items-baseline gap-2px">
              <HvTypography variant="title3">
                {(((i + 1) / (i + 2)) * 100).toFixed(0)}
              </HvTypography>
              <HvTypography variant="caption2" className="text-textSubtle">
                %
              </HvTypography>
            </div>
          </HvCardContent>
        </HvCard>
      </HvGrid>
    );
  })}
  <HvGrid item xs={4} sm={8} md={12}>
    <HvCard bgcolor="atmo1">
      <HvCardContent>
        <HvVizProvider>
          <HvBarChart
            height={300}
            data={{
              Group: ["Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"],
              "Sales Target": [2300, 1000, 7800],
              "Sales Per Rep": [6000, 3900, 1000],
              "Monthly Sales": [3700, 6700, 1100],
              Target: [2100, 7700, 3000],
              Cash: [500, 7600, 7800],
            }}
            groupBy="Group"
            measures={[
              "Sales Target",
              "Sales Per Rep",
              "Monthly Sales",
              "Target",
              "Cash",
            ]}
            horizontal
            grid={{ bottom: 0 }}
          />
        </HvVizProvider>
      </HvCardContent>
    </HvCard>
  </HvGrid>
</HvGrid>
```

## Simple Grid

The [`HvSimpleGrid`](/components/simple-grid) component is an alternative to the grid component mentioned above and it provides an easy way of creating responsive grids where each item takes an equal amount
of space. The items will grow or shrink whenever the screen size changes.

This component should be used whenever you need to create grids where items should be distributed across a specific number of columns with the same width.

This component also enables you to create your own breakpoints and define the spacing and number of columns for each one. Thus, contrary to the grid component,
the simple grid does not rely on the Design System breakpoints. Furthermore, you can only define the number of columns per row and not the span of each grid item
enabling you to create much simpler grids than the grid component.

In the example below a grid with three columns was created to distribute the cards across them, and when the screen width goes under the Design System
`sm` (600px) breakpoint the grid only has two columns.

```tsx live
export default function Demo() {
  const { activeTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <HvSimpleGrid
      cols={3}
      breakpoints={[
        {
          maxWidth: activeTheme?.breakpoints.values.sm,
          cols: 2,
        },
      ]}
    >
      {Array.from({ length: 9 }).map((v, i) => {
        return (
          <HvCard key={i} bgcolor="atmo1">
            <HvCardHeader title={`Card ${i}`} />
            <HvCardContent>
              <HvTypography>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
              </HvTypography>
            </HvCardContent>
          </HvCard>
        );
      })}
    </HvSimpleGrid>
  );
}
```
