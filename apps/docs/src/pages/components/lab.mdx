# Lab

Lab components are experimental components that are not yet stable enough to be part of the [core package](./).
They are available for testing and feedback, but they may not be fully stable or feature-complete, and their API might change.

<Callout type="info">
  Component contributions from external contributors should be added to the lab
  package. Check out our [contributing guide](/docs/contributing#new-components)
  for more information.
</Callout>

Example:

```tsx
import { HvDashboard } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab";
```
