For UI Kit users that want to use drag and drop functionality, the UI Kit team recommends the [@dnd-kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/) library
for its performance, accessibility and extensibility. We strongly recommend checking their documentation.

## Simple sortable list

This sample showcases a scenario where we have a single column and we want to drag items within this column. You can drag the items
by their handle or by using the keyboard. In this case you just have to tab your way to the item and press the `Space` key (or `Enter`)
to select it and then use the arrows to move the item to its new place Then just press `Space` again to release it.

<CodeBlock code={{ main: dndKitSingle, "./types": dndTypes }} />

## Multiple Containers

In this sample we showcase how to use drag and drop between different containers. Note that you can reorder the columns by dragging each
column by its header.

<CodeBlock code={{ main: dndKitMultiple, "./types": dndTypes }} />

## Native Drag and Drop

If you don't want to use any external libraries you can still achieve a similar result by using plain Javascript.

<CodeBlock code={{ main: dndNative, "./types": dndTypes }} />

## Complex example

This example showcases a more complex use case of drag and drop, where we have a kanban board with multiple columns and cards.
You can drag the cards between columns and reorder them within the same column. You can also reorder the columns by dragging them.
You can

<CodeBlock
  code={{
    main: kanban,
    "./data": kanbanData,
    "./types": kanbanTypes,
    "./Components": kanbanComponents,
  }}
/>
