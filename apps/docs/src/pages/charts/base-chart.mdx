### Base Chart

UI Kit provides several chart components that are built on top of the ECharts library. But you might need to create other kinds of charts
that UI Kit doesn't provide. In that case, you can use the `HvBaseChart` component.

The `HvBaseChart` component is a wrapper around the ECharts library that allows you to directly use the ECharts API.
This gives you the flexibility to create any custom chart configuration supported by ECharts.

The example below illustrates how to create a simple Sankey Chart using the `HvBaseChart` component, which is a chart that UI Kit doesn't
provide out of the box. Please notice that you'll need to import the appropriate ECharts components and/or renderers to use them.
In this case, becasue the `HvBaseChart` already imports the `CanvasRenderer` (responsible for rendering the charts) and the `AriaComponent`
(that generates accessible descriptions for the charts), you won't need to import them. But you will need to import the `SankeyChart` component
and use it by calling:

```tsx
echarts.use([SankeyChart]);
```

You might also want to add other components to your chart (like `TooltipComponent`
or `LegendComponent`), check this [ECharts cheat sheet](https://echarts.apache.org/en/cheat-sheet.html) for more information.

```tsx live
import { SankeyChart } from "echarts/charts";
import * as echarts from "echarts/core";

export default function Demo() {
  echarts.use([SankeyChart]);

  return (
    <HvBaseChart
      width={600}
      height={350}
      option={{
        animation: false,
        series: {
          type: "sankey",
          layout: "none",
          nodeAlign: "left",
          emphasis: {
            focus: "adjacency",
          },
          data: [
            {
              name: "Top Area",
            },
            {
              name: "Main Area",
            },
            {
              name: "West Door",
            },
            {
              name: "East Door",
            },
            {
              name: "Main Door",
            },
          ],
          links: [
            {
              source: "Top Area",
              target: "West Door",
              value: 5,
            },
            {
              source: "Top Area",
              target: "East Door",
              value: 8,
            },
            {
              source: "Top Area",
              target: "Main Door",
              value: 3,
            },
            {
              source: "Main Area",
              target: "East Door",
              value: 10,
            },
            {
              source: "Main Area",
              target: "Main Door",
              value: 6,
            },
          ],
        },
      }}
    />
  );
