### Base Chart

**UI Kit** includes several chart components powered by ECharts. For unsupported chart types, use `HvBaseChart`â€”a flexible wrapper around the ECharts API that lets you build fully custom configurations.

The example below demonstrates how to create a **Sankey chart**, which is not available out of the box.  
`HvBaseChart` includes the `CanvasRenderer` and `AriaComponent` by default, but you must manually import and register the `SankeyChart` component from ECharts.

```tsx
echarts.use([SankeyChart]);
```

You can also enhance your chart with additional ECharts components like `TooltipComponent` or `LegendComponent`.  
Refer to the [ECharts cheat sheet](https://echarts.apache.org/en/cheat-sheet.html) for a full list of available components.

```tsx live
import { SankeyChart } from "echarts/charts";
import * as echarts from "echarts/core";

export default function Demo() {
  echarts.use([SankeyChart]);

  return (
    <HvBaseChart
      width={600}
      height={350}
      option={{
        animation: false,
        series: {
          type: "sankey",
          layout: "none",
          nodeAlign: "left",
          emphasis: {
            focus: "adjacency",
          },
          data: [
            {
              name: "Top Area",
            },
            {
              name: "Main Area",
            },
            {
              name: "West Door",
            },
            {
              name: "East Door",
            },
            {
              name: "Main Door",
            },
          ],
          links: [
            {
              source: "Top Area",
              target: "West Door",
              value: 5,
            },
            {
              source: "Top Area",
              target: "East Door",
              value: 8,
            },
            {
              source: "Top Area",
              target: "Main Door",
              value: 3,
            },
            {
              source: "Main Area",
              target: "East Door",
              value: 10,
            },
            {
              source: "Main Area",
              target: "Main Door",
              value: 6,
            },
          ],
        },
      }}
    />
  );
