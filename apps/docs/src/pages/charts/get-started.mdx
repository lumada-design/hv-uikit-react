</Callout>

## Installation

To use the visualizations components, you need to install the `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz` package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz
```

## Apache ECharts

UI Kit's charts are based on the [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) library.
If you need any feature that's not covered by the UI Kit charts documentation, please refer to the [Apache ECharts documentation](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#title).

## Provider

Before using any of the UI Kit visualizations, it's necessary to add the `HvVizProvider` component to your application.
This component is responsible for enabling theming capabilities for the visualizations.

The `HvVizProvider` component should preferably be used at the root of your component tree and should always be wrapped by the `HvProvider` component
since the former uses the themes provided by the latter to configure the visualizations themes.

Thus, you can setup the `HvVizProvider` like so:

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { HvVizProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <HvProvider>
      <HvVizProvider>{children}</HvVizProvider>
    </HvProvider>
  );
};
```

The `HvVizProvider` only accepts a `children` and doesn't need any extra configuration to work.

## Data

The visualizations `data` can have one of the following formats:

- **Columns format**: an object with a set of key-value pairs where the keys are the column names and the values are arrays of identical length containing the row values.

_Examples:_

Both examples represent a table with 3 columns (`Month`, `Sales Target`, and `Monthly Sales`) and 12 rows.

```tsx
{
    Month: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"],
    "Sales Target": [5929, 2393, 1590, 7817, 4749, 1702, 2381, 2909, 6732, 3098, 2119, 2146],
    "Monthly Sales": [4563, 1920, 6738, 1832, 7346, 1938, 7261, 1938, 2739, 5729, 9028, 4562]
}
```

```tsx
new Map()
  .set("Month", [
    "January",
    "February",
    "March",
    "April",
    "May",
    "June",
    "July",
    "August",
    "September",
    "October",
    "November",
    "December",
  ])
  .set(
    "Sales Target",
    [5929, 2393, 1590, 7817, 4749, 1702, 2381, 2909, 6732, 3098, 2119, 2146],
  )
  .set(
    "Monthly Sales",
    [4563, 1920, 6738, 1832, 7346, 1938, 7261, 1938, 2739, 5729, 9028, 4562],
  );
```

- **Rows format**: an array containing a set of objects where each object is a row. Each key-value pair from the row object represent
  the column name (key) and row value (value).

_Example:_

The example illustrates a table with 3 columns (`Country`, `Population`, and `Area`) and 4 rows.

```tsx
[
  {
    Country: "Portugal",
    Population: 10.33,
    Area: 92212,
  },
  {
    Country: "Spain",
    Population: 47.42,
    Area: 505990,
  },
  {
    Country: "US",
    Population: 331.9,
    Area: 9834000,
  },
  {
    Country: "Canada",
    Population: 38.25,
    Area: 9984670,
  },
];
```

- **Arquero table format**: a table created using the [Arquero library](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/). Arquero is a library for query processing and data tables
  transformation. We already use this library internally to manipulate and transform data points. However, we don't cover all the capabilities supported by this library.
  Thus, we decided to support tables created with Arquero as a valid data format for our visualizations.

_Example:_

For instance, if your data is a JSON, you can use Arquero to transform the JSON into a data table and pass it to the visualizations. The example below will create a
table with 2 columns (`Country` and `Population`) and 2 rows.

For more information take a look at the [Arquero API documentation](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/api/).

```tsx
aq.fromJSON('{"Country":["Portugal","Spain"],"Population":[10.33,47.42]}');
```

## Axis types

Regarding the charts that rely on axes, the `xAxis` and `yAxis` are by default of type `categorical` and `continuous`, respectively.
For horizontal bar charts, these default values are inverted.
These types must be updated if necessary depending on the data provided. The valid values are `continuous` for continuous data, `categorical`
for discrete data, and `time` for continuous time data.

## Visual roles

In order to create visualizations, you'll also need to define visual roles for your data table columns. The following visual roles are supported:

- `groupBy`: the data will be grouped based on the columns selected for this visual role.
- `measures`: columns that you want to measure on the chart. For each one of the selected columns, you can
  choose a function to aggregate the values. When no aggregation function is specified, the values will be summed by default.
  The valid aggregation functions are `sum`, `average`, `min`, `max`, and `count`.
- `splitBy`: splits your data based on specific data table columns.
- `sortBy`: sorts data points by specifying the columns to use. For each one of the selected columns, you can
  choose how to order the data points. The values will be sorted in ascending order by default.
  The valid sorting functions are `asc` and `desc`.

Please find below an example with the `HvLineChart`.

_Example:_

In this example, a data table with 4 columns (`Country`, `Year`, `Medal`, and `Total`) and 8 rows
was provided. Since we want to showcase the total of medals for each country over the years, the `Year` column was used for the `groupBy` visual role in order to group
the data by year. Then, the `Total` column was used for the `measures` since it's the column we want to visually measure on the vertical axis.
In this case, no aggregation function was specified for the `measures` since the values will be summed by default. Regarding the `splitBy` visual role,
the `Country` column was used in order to split the data by country and showcase one line for each country. The `sortBy` visual role was also needed since the data
didn't have the years sorted by ascending order originally.

## Filters

You can filter data points by specifying the columns to use and the values to filter. The `filters` prop is an array of objects where each object has the following properties:

```tsx
type HvChartFilterOperation =
  | "is"
  | "isNot"
  | "contains"
  | "notContains"
  | "greaterThan"
  | "greaterThanOrEqual"
  | "lessThan"
  | "lessThanOrEqual"
  | "between"
  | "ends"
  | "notEnds"
  | "starts"
  | "notStarts";

type HvChartFilter = {
  field: string;
  operation: HvChartFilterOperation;
  value: string | string[] | number | number[];
};
```

_Example:_

In this example with the `HvBarChart`, two filters are defined for the `Country` and `Sales` columns. The `Country` filter will only show data points for the selected country,
and the `Sales` filter will only show data points with sales values between the selected range.

```tsx
<HvBarChart
  data={{
    Country: data.map((item) => item.label),
    Sales: data.map((item) => item.value),
  }}
  groupBy="Country"
  measures="Sales"
  filters={[
    {
      field: "Country",
      operation: "is",
      value: country,
    },
    {
      field: "Sales",
      operation: "between",
      value: [sales[0], sales[1]],
    },
  ]}
/>
```
