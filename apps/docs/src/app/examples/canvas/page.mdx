### Canvas

A visual canvas interface for building and executing data flows. Ideal for ETL tools, automation pipelines, and visual programming use cases.  
Drag nodes from the sidebar, drop them onto the canvas, and connect them to define your logic.

<CodeBlock
  code={{
    main: canvasMain,
    "./utils": canvasUtils,
    "./styles": canvasStyles,
    "./Context": canvasContext,
    "./ListView": canvasListView,
    "./Node": canvasNode,
    "./Sidebar": canvasSidebar,
    "./StatusEdge": canvasStatusEdge,
    "./Table": canvasTable,
    "./TreeView": canvasTreeView,
  }}
/>
