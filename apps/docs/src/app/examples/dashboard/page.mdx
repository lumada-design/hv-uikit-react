### Dashboards

While UI Kit doesn't provide a dedicated Dashboard component out of the box, it's still possible to create dynamic
and responsive dashboards along with UI Kit components. Our recommendation is to use the
[`react-grid-layout`](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) library to achieve this functionality.

<CodeBlock code={{ main: dashboard, "./Dashboard.styles": dashboardStyles }} />

## Responsive dashboards

You can configure different layouts for various screen sizes. Resize the window to see how the dashboard adapts.

<CodeBlock code={{ main: responsive, "./Dashboard.styles": dashboardStyles }} />

Check their [documentation](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) for more details on how to use it.
