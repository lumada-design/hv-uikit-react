# What are Canvas components?

Canvas components are a set of UI components designed to address specific needs of Pentaho applications that use
a canvas-based interface. For that reason, they are available in the `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-pentaho` package.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-pentaho
```

## Usage

These components are designed to be used together and react to each other. When the `SidePanel` is opened, closed or resized,
the `Toolbar` and `BottomPanel` will adjust their widths accordingly.

For this to work, you'll need to import the `HvCanvasProvider` component:

```tsx
import { HvCanvasProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-pentaho";
```

And wrap your components with it:

```tsx
<HvCanvasProvider>
  <HvCanvasToolbar>...</HvCanvasToolbar>
  <HvCanvasSidePanel>...</HvCanvasSidePanel>
  <HvCanvasBottomPanel>...</HvCanvasBottomPanel>
</HvCanvasProvider>
```

A sample that exemplifies how the canvas components can be used is available
[here](/examples/canvas).
