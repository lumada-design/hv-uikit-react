# Lab

Lab components are experimental components that are not yet stable enough to be part of the [core package](./).
They are available for testing and feedback, but they may not be fully stable or feature-complete, and their API might change.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Component contributions from external contributors should be added to the lab
> package. Check out our [contributing guide](/docs/contributing#new-components)
> for more information.

Example:

```tsx
import { HvDashboard } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-lab";
```
