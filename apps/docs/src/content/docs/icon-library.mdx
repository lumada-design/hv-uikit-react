# Icon Library

The **UI Kit** includes a comprehensive library of SVG icons packaged as React components, specifically designed for use with the [NEXT Design System](https://designsystem.hitachivantara.com/6c705d900/p/31e481-icons).

These icons are available through the `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-icons` package and are fully compatible with the [`HvIconContainer`](/components/icon-container) API, ensuring consistent sizing, color, and alignment across the system.

```tsx
import { Alert } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-icons";
