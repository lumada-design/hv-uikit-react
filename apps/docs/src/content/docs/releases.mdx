# Releases and Versioning

We are committed to deliver a stable, reliable, and easy-to-adopt product. All updates are introduced through a predictable and transparent release process to ensure consistency and confidence for our users.

## Release Process

From day one, we’ve implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure that every change is thoroughly validated and tested before being published.

- **Weekly Releases**  
  All active branches are released weekly. Code merged during the week is included in the next release, provided it passes all validations in our test suite.

- **Manual Releases**  
  Critical fixes may trigger manual releases outside the weekly cycle when necessary.

- **Preview Builds**  
  During major version development, preview builds such as `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc` (release candidate) are published when a meaningful subset of new features is ready for early testing and feedback.

## Changelogs

Release changelogs are published in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pentaho/hv-uikit-react/releases) section, and relevant updates are reflected in the documentation.

## Versioning

**UI Kit** follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), using the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **Major** releases introduce significant new functionality and may include breaking changes. Upgrading may require code modifications, additional testing, and familiarization with new APIs.
- **Minor** releases introduce new features in a backward-compatible manner. You can adopt new capabilities without altering existing code.
- **Patch** releases focus on bug fixes and minor improvements, and are safe to apply with minimal risk.

## Breaking Change Exceptions

We define a “breaking change” as any modification to public APIs that requires users to change their implementation. However, the following cases are not considered breaking:

- Changes to **unstable APIs**, marked as experimental or prefixed with `unstable_`.
- Changes to **private APIs**, including non-exported or undocumented modules.
- **Minor CSS adjustments**, particularly when aligning with updated design system specifications.
- **Accessibility improvements** that adjust semantics without affecting visual presentation or user-facing functionality (although they may impact tests).
- **TypeScript declaration corrections** when typings were previously inaccurate or misaligned with runtime behavior.
- **Reverts of recent breaking changes**, restoring prior behavior.

## Long-Term Support (LTS)

**UI Kit** offers maintenance—including security updates, bug fixes, and compatibility adjustments—for the **two most recent major** versions. LTS support is available upon request via the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pentaho/hv-uikit-react/issues) page.

## Deprecation Policy

- Deprecations are clearly announced in changelogs and, when feasible, surfaced via runtime warnings.
- Each deprecation includes guidance on how to migrate to the recommended alternative.
- Stable APIs marked as deprecated will continue to function during the deprecation window to ensure a smooth migration experience.
