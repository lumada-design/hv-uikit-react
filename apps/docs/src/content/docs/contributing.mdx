# Contributing

Contributions to the **UI Kit** are welcome ‚Äî whether it's fixing bugs, improving docs, suggesting components, or joining the discussion via GitHub or our community channels.

## Submitting an Issue

Use our [issue templates](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/issues/new/choose) when filing issues.  
Before submitting, search existing issues to check if your question or bug has already been addressed.

### Bug Reports üêõ

If you encounter a bug, please open a [bug report](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/issues/new?template=1.bug_report.yml). Include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce the issue. Even better ‚Äî feel free to submit a pull request with a fix.

### Feature Requests ‚ú®

To suggest a new feature or enhancement, open a [feature request](https://github.com/lumada-design/hv-uikit-react/issues/new?template=2.feature.yml). Feature requests may include new components or improvements to existing ones.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add. All contributions should target the `master` branch or a previous major version (eg. `v4.x`).  
Maintainers will be responsible for reviewing and merging the Pull Request.

### Setup

1. Pull the latest `master` branch.
2. Always work and submit pull requests from a branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME master
   ```
3. Make sure you follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards), and add new test cases where appropriate following the [testing guidelines](/docs/guidelines#other-conventions).
4. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
5. Once ready for feedback from other contributors and maintainers, push your commits to your fork:
   ```sh
   git push YOUR_FORK_REMOTE YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
   ```
6. Open a Pull Request. The title should follow the same [guidelines of the commit message](#commit-message-guidelines) (most of the times it can simply be the same than the first commit message).

Once all revisions are complete and approved, a maintainer will squash and merge your commits.

## New components

New components should be added to the `lab` package at:

```bash
packages/lab/src/<COMPONENT_NAME>
```

Refer to our [Component Guidelines](/docs/guidelines) for structure and conventions.  
For contribution steps, see [Submitting a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request).

## Coding Standards

We enforce consistent code style and formatting using [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

Most modern IDEs support these tools via plugins, helping you follow the project‚Äôs rules automatically.
You can also run the following commands locally to check and fix issues:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run prettier
```

Code that doesn‚Äôt meet our standards will fail in CI and block the merge.

## Local development

To test your changes in a local project, you can link the UI Kit packages using `npm link`.
This allows you to use your local version of the UI Kit in other projects without publishing it.

```sh
# in the UI Kit root directory
npm link -ws

# in your local project directory
npm link @hitachivantara/uikit-react-core
```

If package publishing is required, they can be easily published to a separate registry (eg. [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/)) like so:

```sh
npm publish -w packages/core --registry http://localhost:4873
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to format commit messages consistently. This approach improves readability, makes it easier to understand the project‚Äôs history, and enables automated changelog generation.

Each commit message must begin with a **type**, optionally followed by a **scope**, to clearly communicate the purpose of the change:

```sh
type(scope): description
```

### Common Types

- `feat:` a feature that is visible for end users.
- `fix:` a bugfix that is visible for end users.
- `chore:` a generic change that doesn't impact end users
- `docs:` a change on the documentation
- Others commit types are allowed, for example: `refactor:`, `ci:`, `perf:`, `test:`.

### Examples

```sh
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
feat(lang): add Polish language support
fix(button): minor typo in code, fixes #12
```

## Testing

All new features and fixes must include test coverage. Test your changes by running:

```sh
npm test
```

Our CI pipeline runs:

- Unit tests (Vitest)
- Accessibility checks (axe-core)
- End-to-end tests (Playwright)
- Visual regression tests (Chromatic)

Please keep an eye on the pull request result for detailed feedback and ensure all tests pass before requesting a review.
