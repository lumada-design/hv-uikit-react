# Accessibility

We are committed to building a component library that adheres to accessibility best practices. Our components are developed and tested to align with [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) standards.

Because many **UI Kit** components are custom-built, we pay particular attention to:

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper ARIA attributes and roles

Accessibility is an ongoing effort. If you encounter a component that could be improved, we encourage you to share your feedback — we’re always looking to improve.

> [!WARNING]
>
> While we strive to provide accessible components out of the box, developers
> are responsible for ensuring accessibility within their applications by using
> components correctly and in context.

## Keyboard Navigation

Most **UI Kit** components support keyboard interaction to ensure usability without relying on a mouse or touch interface.

| Key                   | Action                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Buttons**           | `Enter` or `Space` to activate                                                 |
| **Modals**            | `Esc` to close                                                                 |
| **Tabs**              | `Arrow keys` to navigate between tabs, `Tab` to move focus                     |
| **Dropdowns**         | `Enter` or `Space` to select, `Arrow keys` to navigate options, `Esc` to close |
| **Checkboxes/Radios** | `Space` to toggle selection                                                    |
| **Groups**            | `Arrow keys` to move between items, `Tab` to move focus                        |

## ARIA and Role Customization

Many components provide props for enhancing or overriding default accessibility behavior:

- `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
- `role` override (e.g., `role="dialog"` for modals)
- Dynamic ARIA attributes such as:
  - `aria-expanded`
  - `aria-checked`
  - `aria-selected`
  - `aria-hidden`

These are passed directly to the relevant HTML elements when supported.

For advanced accessibility behavior, we recommend referencing the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
