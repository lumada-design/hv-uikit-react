# Forms

Forms are essential to web applications—they're the primary way to collect user input. By providing a consistent structure for capturing and validating data, we ensure a reliable user experience across different applications.

## Form Components

The **UI Kit** includes a set of **form components** designed to offer a **consistent API** and integrate smoothly with native HTML forms, React forms, and form libraries.

All form components are built on top of [`HvFormElement`](/components/form-element), which provides a shared API to handle events, manage `status`, and expose a `value` prop to support controlled components.

> [!WARNING]

> Not all UI Kit form components support native form data serialization or
> validation.

For a complete list of available components, check out [`HvFormElement`’s related components](/components/form-element#related-components).

## Building Forms

There are several ways to build forms in React, each with its own trade-offs. Below are the most common approaches when using the UI Kit.

### Native Form

The simplest method is using an uncontrolled native `form`, taking advantage of [built-in browser validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#using_built-in_form_validation) and accessing form values via `FormData`.

This approach is ideal for **basic forms** using native-compatible components (e.g., `input`), where **custom validation is not needed**.

<CodeBlock code={nativeFormCode} layout="expandable" />

### React form

Whenever you need to manage internal form values or apply custom validation, using **controlled components** with React state is a good approach. In this setup, each form input is tied to a state variable, and changes are handled via the `onChange` event.

<CodeBlock code={reactFormCode} layout="expandable" />

### Form libraries

Working with forms in React can be challenging—handling validation, verbosity, and state management often adds complexity.

Libraries like **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** and **[Formik](https://formik.org/)** help simplify form handling. Both address similar problems, and the **UI Kit** does not enforce the use of either.

Our **Form Components** are compatible with these libraries. However, we recommend using each library’s **imperative set value functions** when handling the `onChange` events of our components. While the APIs are not fully aligned, this approach provides the most consistent and predictable experience.
