## Installation

To use the visualizations components, you need to install the `@hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz` package:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz
```

## Apache ECharts

UI Kit charts are built on [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html).  
For advanced features not covered here, see the [Apache ECharts documentation](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#title).

## Provider

Before using any UI Kit visualizations, wrap your app with the `HvVizProvider` component to enable theming.  
It should be placed near the root of your component tree and must be wrapped by `HvProvider`, as it relies on the UI Kit theme.

```tsx
import { HvProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-core";
import { HvVizProvider } from "@hitachivantara/uikit-react-viz";

const MyApp = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <HvProvider>
      <HvVizProvider>{children}</HvVizProvider>
    </HvProvider>
  );
};
```

The `HvVizProvider` only accepts a `children` and doesn't need any extra configuration to work.

## Data

The `data` prop in visualizations supports the **columns format**:

- **Columns format**: An object where each key is a column name and its value is an array of values (all arrays must have the same length).

Both examples below represent a table with 3 columns (`Month`, `Sales Target`, and `Monthly Sales`) and 12 rows.

```tsx
const data = {
  Month: [
    "January",
    "February",
    "March",
    "April",
    "May",
    "June",
    "July",
    "August",
    "September",
    "October",
    "November",
    "December",
  ],
  "Sales Target": [
    5929, 2393, 1590, 7817, 4749, 1702, 2381, 2909, 6732, 3098, 2119, 2146,
  ],
  "Monthly Sales": [
    4563, 1920, 6738, 1832, 7346, 1938, 7261, 1938, 2739, 5729, 9028, 4562,
  ],
};
```

```tsx
const data = new Map()
  .set("Month", [
    "January",
    "February",
    "March",
    "April",
    "May",
    "June",
    "July",
    "August",
    "September",
    "October",
    "November",
    "December",
  ])
  .set(
    "Sales Target",
    [5929, 2393, 1590, 7817, 4749, 1702, 2381, 2909, 6732, 3098, 2119, 2146],
  )
  .set(
    "Monthly Sales",
    [4563, 1920, 6738, 1832, 7346, 1938, 7261, 1938, 2739, 5729, 9028, 4562],
  );
```

- **Rows format**: an array containing a set of objects where each object is a row. Each key-value pair from the row object represent
  the column name (key) and row value (value).

Example illustrating a table with 3 columns (`Country`, `Population`, and `Area`) and 4 rows.

```ts
[
  { Country: "Portugal", Population: 10.33, Area: 92212 },
  { Country: "Spain", Population: 47.42, Area: 505990 },
  { Country: "US", Population: 331.9, Area: 9834000 },
  { Country: "Canada", Population: 38.25, Area: 9984670 },
];
```

- **Arquero table format**: A table created using the [Arquero](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/) library, which provides powerful data transformation and query capabilities. UI Kit visualizations support Arquero tables as a valid `data` format. While we use Arquero internally, not all of its features are exposed—refer to the official documentation for advanced usage.

For instance, if your data is a JSON, you can use Arquero to transform it into a table and pass it to a visualization.
The example below creates a table with 2 columns (`Country` and `Population`) and 2 rows.

```tsx
aq.fromJSON('{"Country":["Portugal","Spain"],"Population":[10.33,47.42]}');
```

For more details, see the [Arquero API documentation](https://uwdata.github.io/arquero/api/).

## Axis types

For charts with axes, `xAxis` defaults to `categorical` and `yAxis` to `continuous`.  
In horizontal bar charts, these defaults are inverted.

You can change the axis type based on your data:

- `continuous` – for numeric data
- `categorical` – for discrete categories
- `time` – for time series data

## Visual roles

To create visualizations, you must define **visual roles** for your data table columns. Supported roles include:

- `groupBy` Groups data by the selected columns.
- `measures`: Specifies numeric columns to be measured. Defaults to `sum` if no aggregation is provided.  
  Supported aggregations: `sum`, `average`, `min`, `max`, `count`.
- `splitBy`: Splits data series based on the selected columns.
- `sortBy`: Sorts data points by column(s). Defaults to ascending order.  
  Sorting options: `asc`, `desc`.

Please find below an example with the `HvLineChart`.

In this example, a data table with 4 columns (`Country`, `Year`, `Medal`, and `Total`) and 8 rows was used.

To visualize total medals by year:

- `groupBy`: `Year` – groups data by year
- `measures`: `Total` – measures total medals (default aggregation: `sum`)
- `splitBy`: `Country` – displays one line per country
- `sortBy`: `Year` – ensures chronological order since the input wasn't sorted

## Filters

You can filter data points using the `filters` prop—an array of objects that define which columns and values to filter.

Each filter object supports:

- `column`: the column name to filter on
- `values`: an array of values to include

```tsx
type HvChartFilterOperation =
  | "is"
  | "isNot"
  | "contains"
  | "notContains"
  | "greaterThan"
  | "greaterThanOrEqual"
  | "lessThan"
  | "lessThanOrEqual"
  | "between"
  | "ends"
  | "notEnds"
  | "starts"
  | "notStarts";

type HvChartFilter = {
  field: string;
  operation: HvChartFilterOperation;
  value: string | string[] | number | number[];
};
```

In this `HvBarChart` example, two filters are applied:

- `Country`: displays data points for the selected country only
- `Sales`: filters data points within a selected sales range

```tsx
<HvBarChart
  data={{
    Country: data.map((item) => item.label),
    Sales: data.map((item) => item.value),
  }}
  groupBy="Country"
  measures="Sales"
  filters={[
    {
      field: "Country",
      operation: "is",
      value: country,
    },
    {
      field: "Sales",
      operation: "between",
      value: [sales[0], sales[1]],
    },
  ]}
/>
```
